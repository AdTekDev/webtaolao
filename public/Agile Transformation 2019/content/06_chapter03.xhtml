<p class="text-fo">As technology develops at pace and empowers new capabilities throughout the business, not least through emerging areas such as machine learning, leaders will increasingly need to make smart choices about how they balance critical dynamics in order to maximize opportunity.</p>
<p class="text">Marketing Technologist Scott Brinker has described these dynamics as the need to achieve the right balance between technology and people (between automation and humanization), and centralization and decentralization (between scale and speed).<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en1" id="ch03_enx1">1</a></span> When considering the latter dynamic, we need to recognize the advantages that can come from centralizing key processes, data and tools to achieve the benefit of scale across the organization. This enables us to share common practices and standards, deliver more consistent customer experience through shared data, cut out duplicated effort and tools, and establish repeatable processes that enable efficiency. But the counterpoint to this is the need to also optimize workflow for local context, empower teams to experiment and respond at speed, and enable the serving of more personalized customer experiences based on local context (<a href="#ch03_fig_001">Figure 3.1</a>).</p>

<p class="text-fo">When it comes to the other axis, we have the opportunity to harness automation at scale through a coherent technology stack evaluated, integrated and maintained at a global level, and orchestrate the flow between decentralized and centralized data and technology. Yet we also need to invest in the people end of this spectrum to capitalize on human judgement and oversight, to encourage continuous learning, experimentation and knowledge sharing, to tie strategies and activity back to values and culture, to empower individuals to override automation when it’s necessary to protect customer and brand experience, and to enable and inspire empathy and creativity. We need to avoid what Scott calls ‘Jurassic Park’ (using a quote from the film): ‘Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn’t stop to think if they should.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en2" id="ch03_enx2">2</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Scott originated this matrix in the context of marketing technology, but this model captures the critical dynamics across the wider technology organization. It’s easy for businesses to gravitate to extremes when considering the impact of technology but, of course, the truth always lies somewhere in the middle.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch03_h2_002"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_017">Small teams can drive big change</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Greater organizational agility comes from empowered teams that perform well in solving the challenges that really matter to the business. But those teams don’t need to be big. Small, multidisciplinary teams empowered by digital technologies can generate a disproportionate amount of change and value in transformation programmes and beyond.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-67" role="doc-pagebreak" title="67"/>There is a temptation in large businesses to throw resource at problems in the assumption that more brains and bodies mean better solutions. Internal politics results in people being included in the process who don’t really need to be there and don’t contribute much value. Representatives of functions that may be needed only at key points get included in the project team from the beginning and have to attend every update meeting. The result is 20+ people sat in a room trying to move a project forward. Everything slows down.</p>
<p class="text">The reality is that more is not better for team effectiveness. Harvard professor (and specialist in team dynamics) Richard Hackman has shown that one of the key challenges with large teams is in the growing burden of communication.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en3" id="ch03_enx3">3</a></span> Put simply, as group size increases the number of unique links between people also increases, but exponentially (<a href="#ch03_fig_002">Figure 3.2</a>).</p>

<p class="text-fo">Communication in teams is subject to a combinatorial explosion. In other words, as people are added to the team the lines of communication are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-68" role="doc-pagebreak" title="68"/>subject to a rapidly accelerating increase. Communication overhead increases dramatically, which very quickly comes at the expense of productivity.</p>
<p class="text">Small teams have other benefits beyond the ability to align, iterate and move fast. They are also more likely to generate new ideas. An analysis of more than 65 million papers, patents and software projects from science and technology found that whilst larger teams more often develop and consolidate existing knowledge small teams are far more likely to introduce new and breakout ideas.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en4" id="ch03_enx4">4</a></span> James Evans, one of the authors of the study and Professor of Sociology and Director of the Knowledge Lab at the University of Chicago, described how larger teams have a tendency towards building on recent successes: ‘Big teams are almost always more conservative. The work they produce is like blockbuster sequels; very reactive and low-risk.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en5" id="ch03_enx5">5</a></span> Small teams, on the other hand, are more likely to come up with disruptive and innovative ideas and research and appreciate the potential of the work that they are doing.</p>
<p class="text">Hackman defined four key features that are critical to create an effective team in an organization:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">common team tasks that work towards fulfilling a compelling vision;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">clear boundaries in terms of who is in the team, information flow, and alignment with other resources, priorities, policies and teams;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">autonomy to work within these boundaries;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">stability.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">It is therefore critical that we understand the difference between a real team and a looser ‘co-acting’ group, and how a (surprisingly common) lack of clarity, direction and autonomy impairs the ability to move fast.</p>
<p class="text">Jeff Bezos, focused on retaining agility as Amazon scales, has famously described how teams in the company should get no larger than the number of people it takes to feed with two large pizzas (six to eight people). An effective small, multidisciplinary team is comprised of the people and skills areas needed to achieve key outcomes and no more (in the book we outline an effective way of managing dependencies across multiple small teams to ensure that the core team is kept small). This is important since it avoids not only communication problems, but also team-scaling fallacy (the tendency for people to overestimate team capability and underestimate task completion time as team size grows), and relational loss (the feeling that it is difficult to get support in large teams).</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-69" role="doc-pagebreak" title="69"/>The multidisciplinary composition of the team is important not only in achieving outputs, but in encouraging diversity. As Richard Hackman points out, homogeneity of team membership can often be a real problem in project teams since we tend to pick like-minded people to work with. Yet performance and creativity improve with greater diversity (including cognitive diversity and having a substantive range in views about how the work should be structured and executed): ‘It is task-related conflict, not interpersonal harmony, that spurs team excellence.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en6" id="ch03_enx6">6</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Digital technologies have transformed the dynamics of team contribution. Small, empowered teams can originate transformational ideas and successfully apply their capability to build and execute those ideas well. It’s time we reimagined how we resource value creation in business.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch03_h2_003"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_018">Moving away from strict hierarchies</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">There has been a reasonable amount of focus over the last few years questioning the value of strict hierarchical structures in business and asking whether, particularly in the context of today’s digital-empowered and networked operating models, this traditional approach to organization needs to change.</p>
<p class="text">It’s a good question to ask. Despite the fact that the context in which business operates has changed substantially due to the impact of digital technology, most businesses are still structured in ways that made more sense in an industrial age where control, efficiency, scale and minimization of deviance were all important. But does that really make sense in a world that is increasingly characterized by horizontality, networks, data and value flows, systems thinking and platform business models?</p>
<p class="text">The challenges inherent in hierarchy as an organizing principle have already been addressed by some. A broad meta-study of 54 prior studies (covering analysis of over 13,000 teams) conducted by Lindred Greer, Bart de Jong, Maartje Schouten and Jennifer Dannals at Stanford Graduate School of Business (‘Why and When Hierarchy Impacts Team Effectiveness: A meta-analytic integration’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en7" id="ch03_enx7">7</a></span>) found that the net effect of hierarchy on performance was broadly negative. Whilst some expert-based hierarchies helped improve team performance, many others were dysfunctional.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-70" role="doc-pagebreak" title="70"/>Yet hierarchy is not inherently bad. It can bring order, clarity, governance and leadership. But an over-reliance on hierarchy, and an overly fixed view of top-down organizational design can hamper agility and the kind of continuous innovation, team and individual autonomy, customer-centric approaches and strategic and tactical adaptability and responsiveness that are quickly becoming table-stakes for organizational resilience and survival. Functional silos act against the ability to create joined-up, exceptional customer experiences. They hamper the ability to collaborate quickly. They get in the way of cross-functional design and innovation. They limit flexibility of job activity. It’s no accident that (often self-organizing) small, multidisciplinary teams have become the engine of change in many forward-thinking companies. With near-universal access to information, the old ideas of leadership as having all the answers and solutions, which then flow downwards, have become grossly outdated.</p>
<p class="text">Yet there are challenges at the other end of the organization design spectrum too. Some brave businesses have taken a radical approach to the adoption of flatter structures using methodologies like Holacracy,<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en8" id="ch03_enx8">8</a></span> which distributes power more horizontally at scale across the company. Shoe retailer Zappos is perhaps the most renowned example of a business that has adopted Holacracy, yet in spite of Holacracy being around for over a decade there are still very few examples of it being applied successfully at scale and Zappos have admitted that they’ve had to significantly evolve the way it works in their organization since its deployment in 2014.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en9" id="ch03_enx9">9</a></span></p>
<p class="text">So as always, the answer is somewhere in the middle. Organizations need to balance the benefits that can accrue from hierarchy (efficiency, clarity of authority, concentration of specialist expertise, clear lines of communication and simplified career path) with those of a more fluid, evolving structure (agility, adaptiveness, cross-functional collaboration and innovation, speed of delivery). Since many businesses are structured in relatively rigid functional disciplines and hierarchies, the direction of change is clearly towards greater fluidity and challenging the long-standing orthodoxies about the optimal way to organize teams. We need to reinvent organization design around a more nuanced understanding of where hierarchy is beneficial, and where it is not in order to balance the extremes, adeptly manage the interplay between them, and bring a new level of flexibility to structures that can enable far greater organizational agility.</p>

<header><h1 class="title" epub:type="title" id="ch03_h1_002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-71" role="doc-pagebreak" title="71"/>CASE STUDY <span class="emphasis">Haier’s Microenterprises</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="text-fo">The transformation of Chinese company Haier from an ailing fridge factory in Qingdao to one of the world’s largest consumer electronics businesses is an exceptional exemplar of bold thinking in bringing agility to life through culture, management practice and organizational design.</p>
<p class="text">In the 1980s, the Haier factory was deep in debt, and suffering from poor management, dilapidated infrastructure and producing around 80 refrigerators a month. New CEO Zhang Ruimin began to turn the fortunes of the business around through a spotlight on improving product quality, which had been a major problem for the firm. Yet as the company became more successful and grew ever larger, Ruimin was passionate about embedding a culture of entrepreneurship, innovation and agility.</p>
<p class="text">As the company scaled, Ruimin cut back on middle management and separated his 75,000 workforce into more than 4,000 microenterprises (MEs), many of which have only 10 to 15 employees. These MEs act as a network of small companies within the larger company, each with their own profit and loss account, and focused on specific business and customer needs and groups, and have a high level of flexibility to adapt as required without lengthy, bureaucratic sign-off.</p>
<p class="text">There are three main varieties of ME within Haier. ‘Transforming’ MEs are market-facing units that are focused on reinventing legacy propositions for the web-enabled world. A smaller number of ‘incubating’ MEs help to originate entirely new businesses to capitalize on emerging markets or technologies and ensure a continuous stream of breakthrough innovation. A much larger number of ‘node’ MEs sell component products and services (from HR support to design to manufacturing) to Haier’s other market-facing MEs. In this internal contracting approach, MEs are free to go externally for access to services if they so desire, meaning that services that would traditionally be internal monopolies (anything from R&amp;D, to finance, IT, HR and so on, where departments have no choice but to use them) are exposed to market competition and therefore forced to be efficient and best in class.</p>
<p class="text">Haier has turned its own company into a flat organization that is an open marketplace of ideas, talent and resources, with the MEs often in competition for the best. Instead of rigid functional silos, employees are empowered to propose new ideas, which are then put to a vote, and those that are successful become project leaders who can recruit other employees for their venture. Employees have freedom to work on the projects that they find most compelling, and once a project is over the people working on it go back in to the marketplace. Effectively Haier has become <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-72" role="doc-pagebreak" title="72"/>like a fast-moving, networked startup characterized by high levels of agility, self-organization, talent development and entrepreneurship.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en10" id="ch03_enx10">10</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Ruimin instigated a ‘zero distance to customers’ principle designed to create greater customer intimacy alongside responsiveness, with everything being focused on the end-value that is being created for the end-user whether that be a customer in the market, another ME within Haier, or a partner of the business. Compensation is aligned to business performance but also customer value in a concept they call <span class="emphasis">rendanheyi</span>, a mashup of Chinese characters that represents a close link between the value created for customers and that which is received by employees. Base salaries are low but a combination of bonuses, dividends and profit-sharing mean that earning potential is high. This ensures exceptional levels of service and customer experience, greater flexibility in enabling MEs to configure their network of service providers as needed, faster lines of communication between the company and its customers and external partners, but also a collaborative approach to resolve problems to help MEs hit their targets.</p>
<p class="text">Rather than using last year’s performance as a starting point, each ME is set challenging targets for growth ‘outside in’, by a dedicated research unit that looks at what is possible. Those MEs that are market facing are often expected to grow revenues and profit at multiples of the industry average, but the targets do adapt in response to shifting circumstances. A series of metrics that consider user involvement in development, extent of profits derived from ecosystem value and unique customer value are used to track performance alongside more traditional targets and measures.</p>
<p class="text">Haier believes in the principles of open innovation, opening the business up to external cooperation and input in order to generate new propositions, but it also believes that in many instances of corporate open innovation the speed of innovation is very fast outside of the organization, but then slows down dramatically as soon as it comes into the business when it is subjected to embedded processes and rules. In order to mitigate this, employees are empowered to become entrepreneurs and create their own ME to serve specific business needs.</p>
<p class="text">One example of this is when the company needed to move into the three-door refrigerator market (two fridge doors and one freezer door at the bottom). The company put a request for proposals on its intranet as an invitation to bid. One of the employees won the bid and was given seed money to begin building a team and a business. He sensibly brought in some of the other employees that had bid but not won yet had good ideas, and they then hired manufacturing, research, development and marketing capability and talent. They started a business that two years later was generating around US $1.5 billion in revenues.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en11" id="ch03_enx11">11</a></span></p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-73" role="doc-pagebreak" title="73"/>To become more native to the digital world, market-facing MEs are encouraged to innovate to support the move from providing products and services to developing platforms and ecosystems. One example of this is Community Laundry, which grew from a mobile app that enabled Chinese university students to schedule and pay for dormitory laundry facilities, to an ecosystem that hosts many other businesses, retaining a share of the revenue that it takes from the 9 million users of the service.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en12" id="ch03_enx12">12</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The MEs are brought together into groups (called platforms), which are focused mainly on product categories or sometimes key competencies, as a way to coordinate major investment initiatives. Platform owners identify opportunities for cross-platform collaboration, set relevant standards that the rest of the organization can use, and are incentivized to drive platform growth.</p>
<p class="text">Haier’s fast-flowing network of MEs has empowered not only a unique level of agility, but exceptional success, from a failing factory in Qingdao to a multinational consumer electronics giant with revenues of US $35 billion. Over the last decade the gross profits of its core appliance business have grown by 23 per cent annually, performance that has enabled them to acquire other manufacturers including GE Appliances. And the company has generated over US $2 billion in market value from new ventures.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en13" id="ch03_enx13">13</a></span></p>
<p class="text">A central vision focused on quality and service provides a north star for strategy. The lack of hierarchy enables the company to move quickly and means that frontline sales staff can bring customer ideas straight back to top management in order to inform innovation and strategy. The fluidity of their modular structure means that employees are used to continuous change, more comfortable with uncertainty, and can more easily embrace opportunities for entrepreneurialism. It is an organization built for continuous innovation, that is adaptive yet resilient and coherent.</p>

<h2 class="head-a" id="ch03_h2_004"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_019">Changing innovation horizons</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">McKinsey’s Three Horizons model for innovation<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en14" id="ch03_enx14">14</a></span> has long been a definitive way of categorizing the different types of innovation that a company needs to focus on to create lasting advantage. The impact of highly scalable and accessible digital infrastructure and technologies, however, is challenging the model in some critical ways.</p>
<p class="text">The model famously seeks to define the different types of innovation that businesses need to focus on if they are to survive and thrive:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-74" role="doc-pagebreak" title="74"/>Horizon 1 is about incremental improvements or continuous innovation around a company’s existing products, models, or core capabilities. This type of innovation typically focuses on existing markets or utilizes existing technologies that the company is familiar with, and is likely the easiest and most common form of innovation.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Horizon 2 innovations are more about adjacencies, next-generation products and likely focused on extending the company’s existing business model or core capabilities to new markets or customers, perhaps using new technologies. Since this extends into areas that the company is less familiar with, it likely requires thinking and techniques different from Horizon 1.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Horizon 3 innovations are entirely new, breakthrough products or categories that are pushing the boundaries, responding to or taking advantage of disruption, and pushing the company to explore new markets or technologies.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">Originally articulated in the book <span class="emphasis">The Alchemy of Growth</span> in 2000 by Baghai, Coley and White,<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en15" id="ch03_enx15">15</a></span> the model has become a well-referenced way of describing the need for organizations to shape focus and funding on the different types of innovation and how the ability to create ongoing competitive advantage depends on all three types. Whilst it’s easier for businesses to focus on incremental innovation that is closer to existing, well-understood models (Horizon 1), there is a requirement for a more comprehensive approach that recognizes the need for continuous exploration in lesser known areas (Horizons 2 and 3).</p>
<p class="text">Three Horizons presents a way that organizations can concurrently manage optimizing for current growth opportunities whilst discovering and building potential future opportunities for growth. But it is important for businesses to recognize the differences in the way in which you manage each one, for example: approaches to risk and payback; sources of value creation; measures; and the allocation of senior management time.</p>
<p class="text">The source of value creation in Horizon 1 comes from superior execution, in Horizon 2 from ‘positional advantage’ (where you are trying to gain a better position relative to your competitors), and in Horizon 3 from insight and foresight around changing customer and market contexts and opportunities.</p>
<p class="text">McKinsey found that Horizons 2 and 3 required more time from senior leaders, but also a commitment to avoid starving these innovations of resources due to short-term financial pressures. They also found that in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-75" role="doc-pagebreak" title="75"/>Horizon 3, whilst the general hit rate may be lower, successful innovators clustered their experiments into between two to five themes depending on the size of the organization.</p>
<p class="text">Measures through the Horizons also differed. Horizon 1 is more about profit, cash flow and return on invested capital, overseen by experienced business managers. Horizon 2 is more entrepreneurial, so is supervised by ‘business builders’ whose metrics for success might be revenue milestones and net present value. Horizon 3 is far more emergent and so requires visionaries and ‘champions’ who are focused on emerging technological and commercial value milestones.</p>
<p class="text">Yet as Silicon Valley entrepreneur Steve Blank has noted, some of the dynamics that characterize the model, most notably the delivery time for each horizon, have fundamentally changed.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en16" id="ch03_enx16">16</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The McKinsey model accounts for the fact that different industries may have different timescales for innovations to return value (short-cycle industries, for example, may see value created quicker), but in general the impact on profit and cash flow, and current market value is far longer with more emergent innovations than it is for extending core capabilities. Horizon 1 may therefore deliver impact in the short term since it is focused on models and capabilities that are already contributing the majority of value and profit today. Horizon 2 may take three to five years to see a return since it involves extending existing businesses and capabilities. And Horizon 3 may take as long as five to twelve years as it involves more disruptive creation of value.</p>
<p class="text">In the modern environment, however, Blank notes that the time it can take for disruptive ideas to be researched, engineered and scaled to market has been radically transformed by digital technologies and networks. Horizons 2 and 3 may now happen at speed. The potential for new, emergent, even disruptive, ideas to be rapidly prototyped and then to generate scale and take on a life of their own has added an entirely new dynamic: ‘These rapid Horizon 3 deliverables emphasize disruption, asymmetry and most importantly speed, over any other characteristic. Serviceability, maintainability, completeness, scale etc are all secondary to speed of deployment and asymmetry.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en17" id="ch03_enx17">17</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The Three Horizons, whilst still a valid and important way of understanding the different types of innovation that businesses need to continuously focus on, is no longer bound by time. Disruptive businesses, unencumbered by legacy technologies and systems, and entrenched, slower moving processes, can move faster towards generating return from newer, disruptive technologies and models.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-76" role="doc-pagebreak" title="76"/>Blank defines four key ways in which incumbents can counter this kind of rapid disruption:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Incentivizing third-party resources to focus on your goal or mission – open innovation initiatives, allowing external parties to innovate from your data through APIs, creating new marketplaces through platform thinking (Apple and the App store), partnering with entrepreneurs to venture build around aligned goals (Diageo and Distill Ventures<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en18" id="ch03_enx18">18</a></span> would be an example of this), setting incentivized, inclusive challenges (DARPA Prize Challenges is an example of this,<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en19" id="ch03_enx19">19</a></span> as is Elon Musk’s Hyperloop Pod Competition which since 2015 has challenged teams of University students around the world to support the development of functional Hyperloop prototypes<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en20" id="ch03_enx20">20</a></span>).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Acquiring external innovators that can operate at the speed of the disruptors. The challenge here though is the not-insignificant potential for corporate culture, processes, and approaches to stifle any speed advantage that the newer business has.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Rapidly copying new, disruptive models (like Google copying Overture’s pay-per-click model) – this carries with it the risk of not properly understanding customer needs and contexts and so failing to do it well.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Innovating better than the disruptors (like Amazon and AWS, Apple and the iPhone). This is, of course, extremely difficult for a large, incumbent organization to pull off when it is focused on execution, optimization and protecting legacy value creation.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">Three Horizons remains an extremely useful taxonomy, but the trap is that we underappreciate the impact of repurposing existing Horizon 1 technologies into new models at speed, and the rapidity with which new, emergent propositions can be iterated and scaled.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch03_h2_005"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_020">The real challenge with transformation</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Futurologist and Google’s Director of Engineering Ray Kurzweil famously described the life cycle of a technology (or inventions based on technology) as an ‘S-curve’. They begin with a slow adoption, which is then followed by a period of high growth and rapid development, before the growth plateaus into maturity (<a href="#ch03_fig_003">Figure 3.3</a>).</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch03_fig_003">

<p class="figure"><span class="label" epub:type="label"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-77" role="doc-pagebreak" title="77"/>Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">3.3</span> Technology S-curve</p>
</figcaption>
<p class="figure-media"><img alt="A S-curve graph with time on X-axis and maturity on Y-axis. At the beginning, the maturity is slow, beginning at the origin, then it is rapid as time increases, and finally constant." src="images/M03NF003.jpg" title="Figure 3.3 Technology S-curve"/></p>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">It’s important to understand the impact of this trajectory on innovation. Artificial Intelligence, for example, was birthed in the 1950s and has progressed in some critical ways since then but only in the last few years has reached the point of real democratization and more universal business application. Kurzweil noted that it was important that inventions should take account of a future world and not just current contexts,<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en21" id="ch03_enx21">21</a></span> but timing is also critical. Thus, the cycle begins as the enabling factors for the technology innovation come into place, it is then invented, refined and developed, it then matures and becomes a part of everyday life and seems immune from disruption (a belief that is perhaps reinforced by the failure of early disruptors), before being usurped by newcomers and sliding into obsolescence.</p>
<p class="text">The S-curve is a useful way of representing the development of technological innovations but it was Charles Handy who (in his book on making sense of the future, <span class="emphasis">The Empty Raincoat</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en22" id="ch03_enx22">22</a></span>) originally used the S-curve as a way of describing the trajectory of many successful systems. His pattern of overlapping S-curves demonstrates the need for regular reinvention, but also the challenge inherent in disruption and transformation. It’s an excellent metaphor to express the real challenge inherent in transformation.</p>
<p class="text">Let’s say an organization is represented by Curve 1 in <a href="#ch03_fig_004">Figure 3.4</a>. It’s doing well in exploiting its existing advantage and so may be approaching the top of its S-curve. When the new wave of technology or next wave of disruption comes in at Point A that is the moment when it needs to innovate and yet there is little reason to do so since everything looks pretty good. The business is making more money than ever before and is well optimized. There is no reason to look forwards and anticipate a different future and yet that is precisely what they should do.</p>
<figure aria-describedby="ch03_fig_004_details" class="figure" id="ch03_fig_004"><figcaption><p class="figure"><span class="label" epub:type="label"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-78" role="doc-pagebreak" title="78"/>Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">3.4</span> S-curves and the ambiguity zone</p></figcaption><p class="figure-media"><img alt="A time versus performance graph on X-Y axes respectively shows two S-curves that occur for a brief period in the ambiguity zone, which is a set of two dashed lines parallel to the x-axis." src="images/M03NF004.jpg" title="Figure 3.4 S-curves and the ambiguity zone"/></p>

<p class="figure-alt-long">Curve 1 starts with slow performance, then rises rapidly reaching the ambiguity zone and then stagnates as time increases. Curve 2 begins at a point when curve 1 is rising rapidly, below the ambiguity zone, and this conjunction is termed as point A. Curve 2 follows a similar pattern of slow performance, then rapid rise and then reaches a constant phase. The point when curve 2 begins to rise rapidly and meets curve A at its constant phase is termed point B, above the ambiguity zone. The zone when both curves 1 and 2 co-exist is termed ambiguity zone.</p>
</details>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">As the new technology or disruptive force starts to scale, the incumbent organization may well find itself at Point B, caught out by the speed of change. In this instance, it could well already be too late since the incumbent is set up around an existing advantage and has not yet done the work to understand how to create value in the new paradigm. New entrants to the market or nimble, disruptive incumbents <span class="emphasis">have</span> done the work and so can scale fast – too fast for the slow-moving incumbent to catch up. Many organizations, of course, wait until they reach crisis point before actioning significant change but by then leadership credibility and competitive position may already have been damaged irrevocably. As Ray Kurzweil said, we need to invent for what will be rather than what is now. We have to look forwards to Point B and work back to understand when and how we need to make the transition.</p>
<p class="text">There is a second challenge inherent with the shift from one curve to the next, represented by the ‘ambiguity zone’ in the chart. During this transitionary period the business needs to be managing business as usual and delivering to its quarterly targets, shareholder value, and all of the priorities characterized by the existing S-curve, whilst concurrently inventing the business of the future and making the shift to the new S-curve. This is the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-79" role="doc-pagebreak" title="79"/>‘messy middle’ of transformation. The period when a business is effectively trying to change the wheels on the car as it is driving along; the period when it will need to balance resources carefully between the old and the new; the period when it may need to be willing to be misunderstood, to experiment and learn fast, to make intelligent bets on the future.</p>
<p class="text">The real challenge with all of this, however, is that businesses are not only facing one S-curve that they will have to deal with but successive, overlapping S-curves. Continual and restless reinvention is therefore the new normal.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch03_h2_006"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_021">The problem with corporate innovation</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">One of the greatest challenges with corporate innovation is the ability to step outside of existing (often hidden or toxic) assumptions to reimagine existing propositions, relationships or processes from the ground up. It’s hard to argue for a disruptive idea when everything the business currently knows detracts from how viable that idea looks. It’s even harder to execute.</p>
<p class="text">JFC Fuller was an officer in the British Army, a military strategist and historian, and one of the founders of modern armoured warfare. He became chief of staff of the British tank corps from late 1916. His ‘Plan 1919’ from the First World War was a pioneering and ambitious strategy to use new British tanks to roll over the German trenches and strike a decisive sledgehammer blow to the German army that would end the war.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en23" id="ch03_enx23">23</a></span> The plan involved amassing 5,000 heavy and medium British tanks, 3,000 of which would be used to penetrate German defences along a 90-mile front supported from the air. Then 800 faster-moving medium tanks would proceed to attack the German army’s string of headquarters miles behind the trenches to disrupt the command structures. A further 1,200 medium tanks, supported by artillery, airpower, cavalry and truck-mounted infantry would then move rapidly to penetrate far behind enemy lines.</p>
<p class="text">Fuller’s lightning thrust plan was revolutionary. Tanks had until then only been used to open up gaps in the enemy trenches through which foot infantry could advance a few miles. But Fuller was proposing a new form of mechanized warfare that could end the attritional stalemate of trench warfare and focus on disorganizing the enemy. He wrote: ‘Tactical success in war is generally gained by pitting an organized force against a disorganized one.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en24" id="ch03_enx24">24</a></span></p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-80" role="doc-pagebreak" title="80"/>Yet the plan was never used. Fuller’s biographer Brian Holden Reid called Plan 1919 ‘the most famous unused plan in military history’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en25" id="ch03_enx25">25</a></span> Yet as Tim Harford, writing in the <span class="emphasis">Financial Times</span> notes, Fuller had actually created an entirely new military strategy that would be studied by the Germans and implemented to devastating effect in 1940. Fuller had in fact invented Blitzkreig.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en26" id="ch03_enx26">26</a></span></p>
<p class="text">After Fuller’s plan failed to see the light of day in the First World War, many nations still resisted his ideas and believed that tanks should be used in small pockets to support infantry. The army even went as far as stopping the publication of Fuller’s book for several years yet Heinz Guderian, the mastermind behind Hitler’s blitzkrieg, managed to read Fuller’s work after the war and, of course, used it to great impact.</p>
<p class="text">The story is an excellent analogy for why organizations so often look at the new through the lens of the old and ignore the kind of ideas and concepts that can be truly transformational, even if those concepts are originated inside their own organizations: Xerox Parc’s personal computer with mouse and graphical user interface; Steven Sasson’s first digital camera for Kodak; Sony’s Memory Stick Walkman; the IBM Simon; the first touchscreen phone.</p>
<p class="text">In 2010, author and technologist Kevin Kelly wrote about Clay Shirky’s quote that: ‘Institutions will try to preserve the problem to which they are the solution.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en27" id="ch03_enx27">27</a></span> He called it the ‘Shirky Principle’, in reference to the Peter Principle, which says that people in organizations get promoted to their ‘level of incompetence’. Their promotion is based on their previous successes but since skills for one job don’t necessarily translate to another job they eventually reach a level at which they are no longer competent. Their previous achievements prevent them from being fired but they can’t progress further so they stagnate in their incompetence. The Shirky Principle speaks to the idea that complex entities like a company or an industry can become so dedicated to the problem that they are the solution to that often they inadvertently perpetuate or prolong the problem. Companies get stuck in the strategies and thinking that have made them successful before. Path dependence means that decisions and choices are made based on past or present knowledge, limited by the current competency, rather than thinking about what might be possible.</p>
<p class="text">Tim Harford references a 1990 paper by Rebecca Henderson and Kim Clark (Architectural Innovation: The reconfiguration of existing product technologies and the failure of established firms<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en28" id="ch03_enx28">28</a></span>) in which the authors distinguish between different types of innovation based on the components of a product and the way that they are integrated into the system, setting out four key types of product innovation:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-81" role="doc-pagebreak" title="81"/>Incremental innovation:</span> this may strengthen the core components of the product but it also maintains the existing linkages between them (an example would be improving the performance of a car component like a driveshaft without impacting the way in which the car is put together).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Modular innovation:</span> which may change the fundamental technology of the component but still doesn’t change the way in which the system links together (like an automatic transmission).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Architectural innovation:</span> this may change the design but whilst the components may not change significantly the way in which they link together does (like front-wheel drive transmissions).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Radical innovation:</span> which is the most extreme, and involves changing both the technology of the components and also the way in which they link together (electric vehicles, for example).</p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo">Henderson and Clark make the case that architectural and radical innovation can more fundamentally challenge the existing organizational structure and processes, which makes it more difficult for incumbents to respond: ‘architectural innovations destroy the usefulness of the architectural knowledge of established firms, and… since architectural knowledge tends to become embedded in the structure and information-processing procedures of established organizations, this destruction is difficult for firms to recognize and hard to correct.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en29" id="ch03_enx29">29</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Incremental and modular innovation are less challenging to established structures since the system doesn’t fundamentally change. Radical innovation establishes a new dominant design and a new set of design concepts embodied in components that are linked together in a new architecture. Architectural innovation involves the reconfiguration of an established system, linking together existing components in new ways. So it can be harder to perceive and make sense of since it involves similar component parts to the problem that are put together in new ways and so have very different relationships with each other. When an organizational structure and information flow has grown up around the old system, it becomes very difficult for the company to respond in suitable ways. The structure gets in the way.</p>
<p class="text">Henderson uses the example of IBM to demonstrate how a company can respond well even to radical innovation if it fits the structure that already exists. IBM successfully dealt with significant developments such as the semiconductor, the integrated circuit, the hard drive, and the shift to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-82" role="doc-pagebreak" title="82"/>mainframe computing since it was not dissimilar in structure to producing mechanical tabulating machines. Yet when it came to the PC revolution IBM’s initial success came only from going against existing strengths and the advantages of its extant structure, and eventually internal politics rose up and the PC division struggled to cope and was sold off. Similarly, in the First World War, the invention of the tank did not fit existing systems and structures for fighting the war and so the real potential to use it in a very decisive way was missed.</p>
<p class="text">In 1968 programmer Melvin Conway wrote that: ‘organizations which design systems… are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en30" id="ch03_enx30">30</a></span></p>
<p class="text">‘Conway’s Law’ as it became known, was based on the observation that building software requires multiple engineers to communicate with each other frequently in order for the software to work properly, so the interface structure of software naturally shows congruence with the social structure of the organization that created it. This similarity between organizations and designs he called homomorphism, noting that: ‘the very act of organizing a design team means that certain design decisions have already been made, explicitly or otherwise.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en31" id="ch03_enx31">31</a></span></p>
<p class="text">US computer scientist Fred Brooks noted the wider application of this concept in management theory, observing in his early book on software engineering (<span class="emphasis">The Mythical Man-Month</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en32" id="ch03_enx32">32</a></span>): ‘Because the design that occurs first is almost never the best possible, the prevailing system concept may need to change. Therefore, flexibility of organization is important to effective design.’</p>
<p class="text">The point is that when we’ve started to design any system the choices that we’ve already made can fundamentally affect the final output. Organization structure and the design/architecture of propositions are intrinsically linked meaning that architectural or radical innovation become very difficult since they require a fundamental rewiring of the way in which the component parts are linked together. Put simply, the existing way in which the business is organized constrains any innovation that is not incremental or modular. Greater organizational flexibility and fluidity is therefore required to organize quickly to fix mistakes and adapt around new models.</p>
<p class="text">In writing about Conway’s Law, strategist Noah Brier references the work of Harvard Business School professor Carliss Baldwin.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en33" id="ch03_enx33">33</a></span> Baldwin’s work around the so-called ‘mirroring hypothesis’ shows that mirroring between technical dependencies and organizational ties becomes evident as a way of preserving scarce cognitive resources in solving complex problems:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-83" role="doc-pagebreak" title="83"/>People charged with implementing complex projects or processes are inevitably faced with interdependencies that create technical problems and conflicts in real time. They must arrive at solutions that take account of the technical constraints; hence, they must communicate with one another and cooperate to solve their problems. Communication channels, collocation, and employment relations are organizational ties that support communication and cooperation between individuals, and thus, we should expect to see a very close relationship – technically a homomorphism – between a network graph of technical dependencies within a complex system and network graphs of organizational ties showing communication channels, collocation, and employment relations.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en34" id="ch03_enx34">34</a></span></p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">In other words mirroring makes outputs and new products easier to understand when they align nicely to current ways of organizing. This effect, as Noah points out, can be circular: ‘Companies organize themselves and in turn design systems that mirror those organizations which in turn further solidify the organizational structure that was first put in place.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en35" id="ch03_enx35">35</a></span></p>
<p class="text">It may be that in some instances (particularly in the context of incremental or modular innovation) mirroring will result in effective innovations and outputs. But with more radical, architectural innovation that challenges the architectural knowledge, information flows and structure of an organization, mirroring can be counterproductive.</p>
<p class="text">Rapidly changing contexts or emergent capabilities characterized more by higher levels of uncertainty do not suit rigid systems and ways of working that mirror existing ways of doing things. Instead, we need to enable greater fluidity in structures to work back from the system design that we need into a structure that can reflect it. Rigid and deeply hierarchical structures may be good at delivering incremental and modular innovation and supporting optimization and efficiency, but do not lend themselves to the flexibility required for adaptive, emergent problem solving. These types of challenges require small, cross-functional teams that can move quickly, unconstrained by ingrained systems, architecture and thinking.</p>
<p class="text">We need to fundamentally redesign our organizations to reflect both of these needs.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch03_h2_007"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_022">Beyond innovation: the need to constantly renew</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Transformation is about more than just innovation. In fact, there’s much to be said for the argument that becoming an agile business is really about large companies remembering what it’s like to be small again: to do the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-84" role="doc-pagebreak" title="84"/>basics well; to simplify complexity well; to be nimble and not averse to change; to avoid getting stuck.</p>
<p class="text">Yet there is also a distinct mindset shift involved with moving on from being continuously focused on protecting your existing advantage (the obsessive focus on incremental market share changes, or being willing to learn only from the narrow confines of your own sector or industry and not thinking about a broader view of your own capabilities) and the kind of business that can imagine a different future, create the proposition to self-disrupt and then ruthlessly execute against it.</p>
<p class="text">Agile businesses do not wait until the next inflection or crisis point. They are actively exploring the future and their place in it, and remaking the business on a continual basis. Perpetual reinvention.</p>

<header><h1 class="title" epub:type="title" id="ch03_h1_003">CASE STUDY <span class="emphasis">Netflix, and Disrupting Your Own Business</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="text-fo">Netflix launched as a DVD rentals business in 1997 but in its short history has reinvented itself as a business not once but twice on its journey to where it is today. The ability to optimize business as usual whilst also building the business that will potentially cannibalize and disrupt your existing one is a critical area of tension for many organizations. Saying it is easy. Actually doing it is terribly hard, not least because of the economic, resource and emotive challenges that this brings. Netflix is one of the relatively few companies that have shown themselves to be willing to continually reinvent themselves as new waves of technology, market dynamics and consumer contexts hit.</p>
<p class="text">CEO Reed Hastings has talked about how important it was to him on that journey for the company to retain agility as it scaled, as the company grew for it to have fewer rules, not more,<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en36" id="ch03_enx36">36</a></span> but also the importance of focus and context in enabling the big changes to happen. They spend, for example, very little time thinking about what the competition are doing and instead focus their time and their thinking on how they can improve the service for customers. Where you choose to focus your attention is, of course, a key determinant of organizational orientation. Many incumbents, he says, look at you as you are now rather than envisaging what you could become as technology inevitably improves.</p>
<p class="text">Reed takes issue with Andy Grove’s maxim that only the paranoid survive. A key part of selecting where they put their attention, he says, is about having a point of view on the future. Netflix has long made public a point of view on its long-term future, which does just this.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en37" id="ch03_enx37">37</a></span> His point is that if you see everything as a threat then <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-85" role="doc-pagebreak" title="85"/>it becomes a distraction from following your own path, like a game of chess where you need to anticipate several moves in advance.</p>
<p class="text">But the importance of focus and commitment has been critical in their successive transitions. If you need to develop an entirely new muscle as a business, he says, it has to be positioned as essential to survival. You can’t dabble in it. Consequently, when the streaming business began to take shape he deliberately created space between the two competing businesses and teams and even went as far as separating the key management meetings to ensure that the streaming business should and could be built to stand on its own merits.</p>

<h2 class="head-a" id="ch03_h2_008"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_023">The ambidextrous organization</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">The concept of the ‘ambidextrous organization’ was first described by Charles O’Reilly and Michael Tushman in their 2004 HBR article<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en38" id="ch03_enx38">38</a></span> as a way to capture the challenge inherent in businesses being able to make steady improvements to existing models whilst still developing breakthrough innovations. This, they said, was akin to the challenge of constantly looking backwards in attending to the products and processes of the past whilst also gazing forwards and preparing for the innovations that will define a new future.</p>
<p class="text">They studied 35 different attempts to launch breakthrough innovations that were undertaken across nine different industries, looking for those instances where the business was able to simultaneously pursue incremental innovations for existing customers whilst also developing breakthrough innovations for new customers.</p>
<p class="text">The research showed that the companies that had successfully balanced simultaneous exploitation of existing models and more radical exploration of future models shared some common characteristics – most notably in maintaining a degree of separation between the traditional areas and the exploratory ones, so allowing for different processes, structures and cultures to emerge, whilst also keeping links between the units tightly integrated at the senior executive level. More than 90 per cent of these ambidextrous organizations ended up achieving their goals, far higher than the other ways of structuring for breakthrough innovation.</p>
<p class="text">The commonalities and differences between the exploratory and exploitative areas of the business and how they link and interact are key. O’Reilly and Tushman showed that successful ambidextrous organizations had been <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-86" role="doc-pagebreak" title="86"/>able to set up structures that were independent enough to enable breakthrough innovation and different ways of working to emerge whilst connected enough at the senior level to keep them aligned to vision, strategic goals or needs. This requires the senior teams and management to be ambidextrous in understanding the divergent needs of the different kinds of business areas, combining the ability to make difficult trade-offs or decisions with the visionary thinking required of entrepreneurs. The senior team must also be committed to operating ambidextrously. A compelling vision relentlessly communicated by that senior team can articulate a goal and direction that can enable the exploitation and exploring parts of the business to coexist and thrive, and bring to life the benefits of both types of operating model for employees.</p>
<p class="text">The need for breakthrough innovation has certainly not declined since the research was done in 2004, and the business environment has if anything become even more characterized by rapid change and unpredictability. So the concept of an organization that can ambidextrously optimize for the present whilst simultaneously creating the future is a powerful one. Particularly when we consider what happens when there is too much focus on just one of these facets. When 3M, long revered as one of the world’s most innovative companies, appointed James McNerney as CEO in 2000 he brought in many practices that he was familiar with from his time at GE. McNerney focused on driving efficiencies and introduced Six Sigma, the disciplined and data-driven process methodology that seeks to eliminate waste and defects and favours incremental improvements, predictability and repeatability. For the first few years this had the benefit of increasing operating margins from 17 per cent in 2001 to 23 per cent in 2005.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en39" id="ch03_enx39">39</a></span> But as Six Sigma was applied to the research and development processes it killed creativity and disruptive innovation and there was a dramatic fall-off in the number of new, innovative products produced. The company that had been famous for innovations including the Post-it note and Scotch Tape had stifled the very thing that made it successful and unique. It took a new CEO who from 2005 exempted key areas of the business from Six Sigma to take a more balanced approach to exploitation and exploration and rekindle the innovation potential in the business.</p>
<p class="text">In the modern environment where value is increasingly shifting from long-term, sustainable competitive advantage to generating and exploiting a series of transient advantages, businesses need a continuous flow of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-87" role="doc-pagebreak" title="87"/>new propositions and breakthroughs. This can only happen if there is enough separation in the early stages to ensure that new thinking, cultures and ways of working are given sufficient space to thrive and are not suffocated by legacy and hierarchy. But then the bigger opportunity is for these new ideas and operating models to catalyse a much wider transformation across the entire organization. For that to happen, as concepts are commercialized and scaled there should be growing commitment and integration not just at the most senior level, but at all levels through the organization, and a more seamless flow between exploit and explore.</p>

<p class="text-fo"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-88" role="doc-pagebreak" title="88"/>The experience curve is all about exploitation and fulfilling demand but as we discussed earlier, the shifting nature of advantage has added some very different nuance to this. The experience curve works well in stable climates but is challenged in the context of more volatile and rapidly changing environments, which require more frequent innovations and launches. This means that in addition to fulfilling and exploiting demand, businesses need a far more significant focus on creating demand for a succession of new products, services, or propositions – what BCG call shaping demand. This can be represented as a succession of experience curves which are concerned with exploiting existing demand, with a series of repeated ‘jumps’ from one experience curve to the next, as companies generate new waves of product or proposition innovation and value. Similarly, we might represent this as a succession of experience curves through which the agile organization becomes adept at exploiting existing advantage, with a series of related jumps from one advantage to the next (<a href="#ch03_fig_006">Figure 3.6</a>).</p>

<p class="figure-alt-long">Exploiting demand is shown as three parallel downward inclined arrows. Shaping demand are two curves, the first starts from the first exploiting demand arrow, moves upward, and ends in the second arrow, the second curve starts from the second exploiting demand arrow, moves upward and ends in the third arrow. The curves rise rapidly and end with downward bend with the upper arrow.</p>

<p class="text-fo">BCG notes that the two types of experience are characterized by different approaches and strategic needs, as mentioned earlier. Since the experience curve is shaped by exploiting and fulfilling demand it is defined by logical, more linear and deductive processes structured around repetition, generating greater efficiency and incremental improvement. We might capture data relating to transactional costs, look for opportunities to improve, and put in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-89" role="doc-pagebreak" title="89"/>place changes: in other words, inductive thinking (based on directly observable facts) and deductive thinking (logic and analysis, typically based on past evidence). The experience of shaping demand on the other hand, is characterized by <span class="emphasis">abductive</span> thinking where we might think creatively, imagine what is possible, form hypotheses about customer needs, new sources of advantage, the potential of new technologies, and then test and prototype, learn based on empirical results and either shut, pivot or rapidly expand. Businesses tend to become highly proficient at inductive and deductive reasoning but are generally poor at abductive thinking. All three are essential.</p>
<p class="text">Ultimately, long-term competitive advantage has perhaps always been about being adept at both types of experience but in today’s fast-moving, complex environments it is the degree of focus placed on each that is important (most companies get very good at fulfilling demand over time at the expense of shaping demand), and the fact that the required speed with which you cycle between the two has increased dramatically.</p>
<p class="text">Netflix is a great example of a business that has been adept at getting this balanced ambidexterity right, undertaking a succession of pivots from mailing DVDs to streaming films to investing now in original content. They successfully anticipated the shift to content streaming, and were able to manage the existing business whilst still growing a disruptive new proposition. Now, in a relatively short space of time, they have grown their investment in original content to a reported US $13 billion for 2018, more than HBO and even CBS.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en41" id="ch03_enx41">41</a></span> In shaping demand in this way they are raising customer expectation significantly and generating significant advantage.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch03_h2_010"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_025">From scalable efficiency to scalable learning</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Small teams can be engines for change in a large organization. The team, as strategist Russell Davies once described it, is the unit of delivery.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en42" id="ch03_enx42">42</a></span> But the team can also catalyse learning and transformation since we learn better when we learn together. Large organizations are typically dominated by a focus on efficiency and execution – managing repeatable tasks, minimizing variance and rewarding conformity. Qualities that work well in stable environments with well-understood contexts that change slowly but ones that work less well in rapidly changing circumstances characterized by greater uncertainty. Qualities that can bring operational cost savings and improved productivity and process efficiency, but which can also act as a brake on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-90" role="doc-pagebreak" title="90"/>cross-discipline collaboration, and knowledge and insight development. We need to break down these barriers to effective learning and reorient the organization to learn at scale.</p>
<p class="text">Harvard Business professor Amy Edmondson (in her book <span class="emphasis">Teaming: How organizations learn, innovate, and compete in the knowledge economy</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en43" id="ch03_enx43">43</a></span>) talks about how organizing to learn should be reflected in the broadest possible set of approaches, functions and processes right across the organization:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote">To keep up with developments in their field, people must become lifelong learners, and success will belong to those who can master new skills and envision novel possibilities. Employees must absorb, and sometimes create, new knowledge while executing. Because this process typically happens among individuals working together, collective learning – that is, learning in and by smaller groups – is regarded as the primary vehicle for organizational learning.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en44" id="ch03_enx44">44</a></span></p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">We should look to recruit experimenters and problem solvers rather than conformers and rule followers, we should train to learn by doing rather than always learning before doing, we should champion the integration of knowledge over separate and siloed know-how, we should empower staff to explore and experiment, use variance as an opportunity to improve rather than try to drive it out, ask ‘what did we learn?’ more than ‘was it done in the right way?’.</p>
<p class="text">The point is that lifelong learning is something that we should pursue not only as individuals but is also something that is critical at a team and an organizational level. We hear a lot these days about ‘failing fast’, ‘fail happy’, ‘embracing failure’. This is not that helpful. Failure in isolation is a redundant standard. Far better to talk about learning, and how we can support continuous improvement from understanding, reflecting on and responding to both successes and failures. As Amy says:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote">When facing an uncertain path forward, trying something that fails, then figuring out what works instead, is the very essence of good performance. Great performance, however, is trying something that fails, figuring out what works instead, and telling your colleagues all about it – about both the success and the failure.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en45" id="ch03_enx45">45</a></span></p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">This shift in value towards organizational learning over leveraging dominance in scale and efficiency represents one of the most impactful disruptions in corporate advantage. John Hagel and John Seely Brown at Deloitte have described this as the shift from ‘scalable efficiency’ to ‘scalable learning’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en46" id="ch03_enx46">46</a></span></p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-91" role="doc-pagebreak" title="91"/>Corporate history has long been characterized by the advantages that can be derived from size and volume and the ability to drive down costs, improve margins and gain scaled efficiencies over time. As new transportation, communication and manufacturing technologies emerged in the 1800s so did a new breed of company, structured to leverage the scaled benefits of new production, distribution and marketing capabilities. These organizations were architected around efficiency, concentrating transactions into a single enterprise in order to reduce transaction costs in much the same way as Ronald Coase describes in his famous essay on the nature of the firm.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en47" id="ch03_enx47">47</a></span> Firms, said Coase, exist to economize on the cost of coordinating economic activity.</p>
<p class="text">This focus on leveraging scaled efficiency has long shaped organizations around the need for control, consistency, stability, certainty and predictability, resulting in top-down command-and-control hierarchies, longer-term planning and forecasting, vertical functional silos and standardized, rigid processes. Through the 20th century this has served companies well, but in the process, there has been a significant corporate trade-off between scaled efficiency and the ability to learn quickly, to be flexible, adaptive and experimental.</p>
<p class="text">Put simply, it’s very difficult to find the space to explore new possibilities, to try out new things and even to adapt quickly when the organizational structure, processes and culture have grown up specifically around mitigating divergence from the norm, risk, exploration, deviance and non-conformity. Experimentation, curiosity and improvisation are the fuel for rapid learning. Limit those, and organizational learning is also limited.</p>
<p class="text">In times of stability and slower moving contexts the pre-eminence of scalable efficiency makes sense. But when the environment changes to be characterized by much higher levels of disruption, unpredictability and rapid change, the trade off with the ability to learn at scale and at speed becomes a distinct disadvantage. Digital technologies and models can (and have) dramatically reduce transaction costs; for example, the ability to leverage third-party capability, knowledge and investment, thereby reducing the advantage that comes from vertical integration and scale.</p>
<p class="text">Hagel and Seely Brown write about the need to develop new relationship architectures within, across and outside institutions to break these performance trade-offs, expand what’s possible, and value scalable learning over scalable efficiency. As competitive, market and customer contexts change ever more rapidly the value of existing, relatively static stocks of knowledge within the organization can depreciate fast, emphasizing the need to create mechanisms, relationships and spaces that are designed to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-92" role="doc-pagebreak" title="92"/>increase the flow of information, learning and adaptation. An inability to learn quickly in these contexts creates vulnerability and fragility:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote">We have reached an important turning point where success is not defined by scale, but by the ability to learn (and unlearn) more rapidly. The traditional model of ‘punctuated equilibrium’ in which companies move from one stable state to another is dead, and companies need to adopt a state of ‘continually becoming’ to keep up with rapid changes in the environment.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en48" id="ch03_enx48">48</a></span></p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">Digital technologies have enabled radically different ways to connect with more diverse and useful sources of knowledge and information both inside and outside the organization, whether through the power of open-source, crowd-sourcing, talent-pools, a myriad third-party insight sources, or through the flow of data through APIs. It has ensured that potential complexities and transaction costs around connecting with multiple external sources of value have been mitigated and reduced. It’s never been easier to get rapid answers to questions, to access exceptional expertise, and to create and maintain communities focused around collaboration, expertise and knowledge. These kinds of knowledge-based networks can benefit from the easy flow of information, the exponential value curve that comes from network effects (every additional participant in the network increases the value of the network as a whole), and thereby increase the speed and scope of learning of everyone involved. New potential can be realized.</p>
<p class="text">This is no small shift. As Hagel and Seely Brown noted in their Deloitte report: ‘Fundamentally different types of institutions may be necessary that break those constraints and harness new tools and practices to simultaneously drive both accelerated learning and high levels of efficiency in rapidly evolving environments. To do so, we need to rethink the rationale for firms.’ In order to remodel from scaled efficiency to scaled learning we need a fundamentally different type of organization.</p>
<p class="text">Advantage was for many years defined by scale. Then, more recently, it became about adaptive scale. Now advantage is firmly rooted in the ability to learn fast at scale (<a href="#ch03_fig_007">Figure 3.7</a>).</p>

</header>
<p class="text-fo">Launched in 2006, Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA)<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en49" id="ch03_enx49">49</a></span> is an end-to-end service that Amazon created to enable millions of third-party sellers to utilize the Amazon platform to sell and fulfil orders. Used by sellers in more than 100 countries, the service enables sellers to take advantage of the full suite of Amazon service propositions from storing product in Amazon’s estate of local fulfilment centres, to using their thousands of employees to sort, pack and ship products to customers, taking advantage of Amazon’s Prime benefits and delivery services, to export products easily to customers in 185 countries around the world, and even to handle returns and make use of Amazon’s customer service team.</p>
<p class="text">Through FBA, Amazon provides a suite of tools to enable better sales management including pricing optimization, business analytics and recommendations that effectively allow third-party sellers to manage their business from any device wherever they are.</p>
<p class="text">FBA is an excellent example of digital-native thinking. Instead of being concerned that third-party sellers would cannibalize Amazon sales, the company has established a platform ecosystem that facilitates a productive relationship between Amazon, third-party sellers and customers, which is beneficial for all. As sellers sell more on the Amazon Marketplace platform, the value increases for everyone in the ecosystem.</p>
<p class="text">As of the fourth quarter of 2018, 52 per cent of paid units sold on Amazon were sold by third-party sellers and in the whole of 2018, they generated over US $42 billion of sales in seller-service revenues (an increase of over a third from the previous year), a revenue segment that is second only to Amazon’s retail product sales in value.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en50" id="ch03_enx50">50</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Marketplace and FBA give Amazon greater scale and leverage, but critically they also give the company scaled learning at speed. As more sellers come onto the platform and more transactions go through Amazon systems, they accumulate ever-increasing amounts of data that enables them to learn better and faster than anyone else.</p>

<p class="text-fo">So, as we’ve established, the agile organization is one that is characterized by continual change, reinvention, responsiveness and manoeuvrability: able to capitalize on the potential of small teams to support transformation, agility and adaptiveness at scale; able to maintain a high level of fluidity around resourcing to avoid the mirroring challenges inherent in architectural and radical innovation; able to manage high levels of ambidexterity in managing <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-94" role="doc-pagebreak" title="94"/>business as usual whilst concurrently inventing the business of the future; able to be adept at both fulfilling and shaping demand.</p>
<p class="text">The Austrian-born economist Joseph Schumpeter, who taught at Harvard for many years, defined the process of technological change as being divided into three key stages: Invention (ideas); Innovation (the development of new ideas into marketable products and processes, or commercialization); Diffusion (scaling or adoption).<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en51" id="ch03_enx51">51</a></span> Given the need for not just episodic innovation but continuous innovation that is both broad and deep, we need to structure a new type of organization that is defined by a perpetual cycle of exploration, execution, extension and exploitation (<a href="#ch03_fig_008">Figure 3.8</a>):</p>
<ul class="list"><li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Exploration:</span> the search for underserved customer needs, new customer problems to solve, new propositions, new efficiencies, new relationship structures, value from new technologies, better ways of working. Exploration needs to be embedded and continuous.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Execution:</span> the ability to commercialize, generate early value, to build scalable models around new propositions, to shape resourcing, technology and processes in ways that can enable rapid growth. Without this stage there is often a ‘missing link’ between early-stage ideas and scaled solutions that have real business impact.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Extension and exploitation:</span> a focus on operationalizing, extending and growing the proposition to maximize the potential, exploiting the advantage created through experience and greater efficiency over time. This stage is necessary for fully optimizing the opportunity from existing advantage.</p></li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p class="text-fo"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-95" role="doc-pagebreak" title="95"/>Innovation cycles needs to be expedited so that they operate in months, not years, generating a continuous flow of new experiments and initiatives. But beyond this, the whole organization needs to be set up to support this flow of new value.</p>
<p class="text">If you were to design organizations from the ground up for today’s complex adaptive environments you would not design a business that is shaped overwhelmingly by exploitation of existing advantage, functional silos that inhibit horizontal collaboration, and slow-moving bureaucratic practices. There is a need for an entirely new type of organization that is set up around continuous innovation and change.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch03_h2_012"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_027">A structure for continuous innovation</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Having defined the key jobs that an agile organization is required to do in terms of exploration, execution and extension and exploitation, we need to align resourcing, process and people around these tasks. Researcher Simon Wardley has articulated a useful way of framing the unique skills and different resourcing characteristics needed to bring products and services to life but also that typically characterize these stages – pioneers, settlers and town planners.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en52" id="ch03_enx52">52</a></span> Each of these archetypes are brilliant in their own way, but draw on different capabilities that enable us to map them to the organizational job-to-be-done:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Pioneers:</span> seek out new territory for the business, originate entirely new concepts, use foresight to create new future possibilities. Their failure rate is likely to be the highest out of the archetypes, but they will generate the concepts that can shape a new future value for the organization. Pioneers map to the exploration stage.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Settlers:</span> take the possible future and make it a reality, partial ideas and make them complete, early-stage ideas and ensure they are commercially viable. They build business models around great ideas, make new products and services scalable, understandable, build trust and cohesion. Settlers map to the execute stage.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Town planners:</span> industrialize, operationalize, optimize. They make models, products and services work at scale, benefit from economies of scale, and then extend them into new areas of opportunity, make them faster, better, more efficient over time. Town planners map to the extend-and-exploit stage of the cycle.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">Simon represents the traditional product or proposition evolution cycle as an S-curve with early-stage solutions beginning by being largely custom built, before being scaled, and ultimately reaching the point where it is increasingly commoditized and becomes more of a utility. As the product life cycle progresses over time, certainty will increase as the organization develops experience, but so does the ubiquity of the proposition (<a href="#ch03_fig_009">Figure 3.9</a>).</p>

<p class="text-fo">We can also map our people archetypes on to this graph. Pioneers will work in the earliest genesis stages of the proposition. Settlers will create custom-built versions and create scalability. Town planners will operate at the volume end, drawing value from more commoditized and ubiquitous services and propositions. As a result of this, the way in which each of these archetypes works is different:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Pioneers:</span> will be experimenting iteratively, prototyping in-house, and likely using Agile or Lean Startup working and techniques.

<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Settlers:</span> are focused on developing understanding, differentiating specific features that will be useful, growing a market, generating profitability. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-97" role="doc-pagebreak" title="97"/>They work with constant feedback and improvement and so will likely still use iterative working methodologies. They understand growth, trends, working with customer feedback loops.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Town planners:</span> operate in mature markets, high-volume and more stable environments, understand well-defined segments, optimization, operational efficiency, analytics, building what the business needs.

</ul><p class="text-fo">Later in the book I’ll be looking at how an organization might map the different jobs-to-be done and apply appropriate resourcing and processes to these different domains. Being an agile organization doesn’t mean that agile is the default process, but it does mean more sophisticated thinking around the application of different working methodologies, and where we do Agile, and where we need to simply BE agile.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch03_h2_013"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_028">The dual operating system</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Given the need for organizations to be ambidextrous and to continue to deliver against existing competitive advantage whilst still inventing the business of the future, we need to rethink our approach to organization design.</p>
<p class="text">Harvard Business School professor John Kotter (in his book <span class="emphasis">Accelerate: Building strategic agility for a faster-moving w</span><span class="emphasis">orld</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en53" id="ch03_enx53">53</a></span>) has argued that in order to create true agility and responsiveness businesses need to create a ‘dual operating system’ designed to enable the rapid development of new ideas and models whilst still maximizing the operational efficiencies needed to manage business as usual. When companies start out as startups, they are naturally small and highly networked organizations but as they scale, they require management and greater efficiencies and so the hierarchical side of the business grows over time. But as innovation slows and competitive pressure grows, the need for ever-greater efficiency results in an entirely hierarchical business, which has lost that networked capability. Kotter’s thought was about the need, in a rapidly changing business environment, to reintroduce some of the networked model to the organization.</p>
<p class="text">As organizations become larger, they often become more internally focused, and innovation becomes additive to those in the hierarchy who are busy enough dealing with the day job. This lack of space for continual experimentation is a real challenge. Leaders and managers taking responsibility for new projects are often expected to run the new initiative whilst still <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-98" role="doc-pagebreak" title="98"/>doing everything that they were before. No one ever thinks about what we can stop doing in order to free up time and resource to start something new. Another critical challenge in strictly hierarchical organizations is just how difficult cross-disciplinary collaboration becomes. Departments operate to their own agendas. Leadership status is determined by size of team or budget. Making quick decisions that involves different inputs or disciplines becomes problematic. Over time the primary orientation becomes what’s right for the department rather than what’s right for the customer.</p>
<p class="text">As we discussed earlier, strict hierarchies get very good at exploiting existing advantage but are pretty terrible at being responsive to rapid change and embedding exploration and experimentation into the fabric of how they work. Given the modern business environment, businesses need to more proactively create structures that can deliver greater agility. The big opportunity is that alongside the ability to deliver business-as-usual and optimize existing advantage via traditional hierarchies, we can use small, multidisciplinary teams to create a more networked element to the business (<a href="#ch03_fig_010">Figure 3.10</a>).</p>
<figure aria-describedby="ch03_fig_010_details" class="figure" id="ch03_fig_010"><figcaption><p class="figure"><span class="label" epub:type="label">Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">3.10</span> Hierarchy and networks</p></figcaption><p class="figure-media"><img alt="Two images representing hierarchy and network.

<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Hierarchy: One person at the top of the hierarchy leads a team of 5. Each of the 3 people from this team further head other teams in the next level. Starting from the bottom, multiple members together form multiple teams. Each team falls below members of another team higher up the order. The number of teams at each level decreases until a minimum number of teams connect to a single team of members up the order. The members of the single team connect to one person at the topmost level in the hierarchy.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Network: Multiple groups of people, which are mutually exclusive and independent of one another connect to a single group of members at the center.</p></li></ul>
</details>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">Later we’ll discuss some of the opportunities and challenges that arise when shifting to this way of operating, but it is important to understand that there is no one blueprint for how this should happen. Small cross-functional teams may be aligned to significantly different objectives from optimizing customer journeys, to specific innovation projects, to solving key business challenges. Every business will have its own contexts and objectives that will dictate a different approach. And there will be significant challenges along the way as the organization learns how to balance different <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-99" role="doc-pagebreak" title="99"/>ways of working, manage different priorities, and be adaptive with the change so that it might be successful in the long term.</p>
<p class="text">But the point is that through doing this the business is proactively embedding more nimble ways of working whilst still hitting its targets. You’re not breaking the business, nor are you playing at the edges of transformation. You’re bringing greater agility to the company, enabling more fluidity to resourcing, more adaptability in addressing key customer and business challenges, and capitalizing on the ability of small teams to drive big change.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch03_h2_014"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_029">Building a service-oriented architecture</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Traditional organizational structures organize functional expertise into silos that can benefit from shared learning, and greater efficiency. This works well in a vertical sense, to align a functional team more easily around common practices, approaches and standards, and to provide functional governance and a career path. But it is terrible for horizontal collaboration. In an age that requires a step-change in cross-functional working we need to find new ways to empower concurrent multidisciplinary running. Alongside the ability to scale small, multidisciplinary teams as an engine for continuous change, we need to catalyse more seamless cross-functional working through the development of a service-oriented architecture and the use of APIs (Application Programming Interface – a set of definitions and protocols that can connect systems and services and enable data and utility exchange between them). There are three key types of API:<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en54" id="ch03_enx54">54</a></span></p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">open or public APIs that have no restrictions on access;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">partner APIs that are made available only to strategic partners;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">private or internal APIs that expose systems or capabilities internally, and which are most often not open to external use.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">Internal APIs can enable an organizational operating model to be built around a service-oriented architecture (SOA) where individual teams and functions can make data and resources available as a service to other teams that might need them. Whilst this approach is not without its challenges (including the discovery of relevant resources, managing demand, and also support), it has the potential to support far greater agility by making more data and capability available on demand as and when they are needed. Consider how frequently in a large organization one team <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-100" role="doc-pagebreak" title="100"/>requires information, resources or numbers from another team and just how slow that process can be through manual processes and e-mail. This is compounded by the fact that most organizations have grown up with multiple systems that don’t share data or talk to each other meaning that breadth of access to relevant data becomes difficult.</p>
<p class="text">Amazon was, of course, the first scaled organization to realize the potential of APIs to enable a truly innovative operating model that has given them (and continues to give them) considerable advantage. As far back as 2002, Jeff Bezos issued an infamous mandate concerning how software was to be built at Amazon (paraphrased here):</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">It doesn’t matter what technology they use.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Anyone who doesn’t do this will be fired.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en55" id="ch03_enx55">55</a></span></p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo">The mandate was undoubtedly provoked by the increasing cost and sluggishness in not having a consistent way of exchanging capabilities and data between different teams and functions. But it resulted in the business transforming internally into a SOA where every team interacts through APIs, defines what resources they have and makes them available through web services so that other teams can independently access and reuse them to support business outcomes. Amazon had created its own internal API economy and a business that thinks of everything in a services-first way, but it had also created the platform on which it could build an almost unassailable advantage.</p>
<p class="text">This SOA approach was taken to a whole new level by the successive externalization of capability, effectively establishing separate parts of the company as individual platforms, opening them up to external competition and ensuring that they avoid the inefficiencies that can come from internal monopolies or vertically integrated businesses (in other words avoiding the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-101" role="doc-pagebreak" title="101"/>danger of becoming fat and complacent from having a captive, internal customer without external competition).</p>
<p class="text">This approach means that Amazon gains greater leverage and learning through scale, services have to compete on the open market ensuring greater efficiency, and in effect that Amazon becomes Amazon’s largest customer. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is perhaps the most obvious example of where they have turned their own technology infrastructure into a hugely valuable externalized product. In 2018 AWS brought in US $25.7 billion, which represented a 47 per cent year-on-year increase and is more than McDonald’s brought in in that entire year.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en56" id="ch03_enx56">56</a></span> AWS taught Amazon the true value of creating externally facing, service-driven platforms from internal services, so future-proofing operational capability against inefficiency, complacency and stasis. A succession of services including fulfilment infrastructure, contact centres, and even pricing have been turned in revenue generating platforms that exist by their own merits in the open marketplace. Their open approach to the development of the Alexa platform, for example, has enabled developers to create an ecosystem of ‘skills’, immeasurably increasing its value to customers (as of December 2018 there are over 70,000 skills on the platform<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en57" id="ch03_enx57">57</a></span>). Opening up the capability to integrate Alexa into third-party devices means that it is now being incorporated into everything from TVs to lighting to clocks to cars. It is now fast becoming an Amazon Operating System and in the process on its way to positioning itself as the default voice Operating System for the smart home and smart car.</p>
<p class="text">Yet it is the internal API economy, and SOA that has truly enabled them to retain agility as they have scaled. In this scenario teams become partners of each other, loosely coupled but able to draw on copious resources at will. Able to collaborate horizontally at speed, capitalizing on free-flowing access to data and resources. Open to innovation from anywhere, not limited by core systems that are locked up.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch03_h2_015"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_030">The post-digital organization</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">The concept of going ‘beyond digital’ was first mooted as far back as 1998 by Nicholas Negroponte in a <span class="emphasis">Wired</span> essay that talked about how ‘digital’ will ultimately become quite banal. He wrote: ‘Its literal form, the technology, is already beginning to be taken for granted, and its connotation will become tomorrow’s commercial and cultural compost for new ideas. Like air and drinking water, being digital will be noticed only by its absence, not its presence.’</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-102" role="doc-pagebreak" title="102"/>Fast-forward 20 years and there remain organizational challenges around adapting mindsets, cultures and approaches to become more native to what is now a truly digital world.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en58" id="ch03_enx58">58</a></span> Yet the aspiration for organizations has to be that we can move beyond instances where ‘digital’ is any way a separate thing. Where projects and propositions begin with questions that ask whether the thing we’re working on is a digital thing or an analogue thing. We should simply be doing the right thing, whether that is digital or not.</p>
<p class="text">The practice of digital may still require defined, specialist expertise but every organization should be aiming for a place where thinking and evaluation is neutral to platform or channel. Where digital is truly integrated. And where culture and practice reflect this. Digital should be lived, breathed, known, understood to the extent that is habitual behaviour to do things in ways that are native to the digital empowered environment. To quote strategist and blogger Russell Davies:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote">The only way to be a Post Digital business is to be a thoroughly, deeply, massively digital one. To be digital in culture not just in capabilities. To know how to iterate in public, to do experiments not research, to recognize that it’s quicker and better to code something than it is to describe it in meetings. You need to be part of the wider digital culture, to have good sharing habits, to give credit where it’s due.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch03_en59" id="ch03_enx59">59</a></span></p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">It’s a good aspiration to have.</p>
