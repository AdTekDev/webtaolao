<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_001">The key elements of ‘scaling fast’</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Scaling fast is all about capitalizing on continuous learning to scale change and agility more widely through the business:</p>
<ul class="list"><li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Scaling agile structures:</span> growing beyond a small number of agile teams to create a more networked organization, understanding the key stages of growth.</p></li>

</ul><h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_002">Agile structures at scale</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Scaling beyond a few agile teams requires a more defined approach to structure, alignment and interdependencies. A popular approach to scaling agile (but not the only one, of course) is to apply learning from Spotify’s model of Squads, Chapters, Tribes and Guilds (<a href="#ch07_fig_001">Figure 7.1</a>):</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-200" role="doc-pagebreak" title="200"/>Squads:</span> small, multidisciplinary teams (of no more than 10 people) are the basic units of development at Spotify. Squads are co-located, often self-organizing, but focused on particular areas of the product or service, a specific customer need or interface. They work iteratively in sprints and have highly focused KPIs relating to their area of responsibility. Teams comprise all the skillsets needed to achieve the desired outputs from design, to development, to testing, release and production.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Tribes:</span> Squads are grouped together by business area. No more than 150 people in a Tribe. Environments that support intra-squad contact and regular gatherings for show and tell, shared learning. The Tribe leader is responsible for coordination across the different Squads and with other Tribes, managing resourcing, budgets and inter-dependencies, establishing priorities.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Chapters and Guilds:</span> these link Squads together horizontally, enabling inter-team knowledge sharing and wider organizational best practice. Chapters are the groups of functional experts who do similar work (like UX, for example) within a Tribe. The Chapter lead is a Squad member but is likely to be the line manager for other functional experts in that Tribe, and is responsible for performance review and people development, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-201" role="doc-pagebreak" title="201"/>functional meet-ups to support learning. The Guilds are looser, more wide-reaching communities of practice or interest that can stretch across the whole company, enabling better knowledge, practice and tool sharing across the wider group.</p></li>

<p class="text-fo">Agile and organizational coaches at Spotify Henrik Kniberg and Anders Ivarsson, who originally wrote about the model, described it as like a matrix organization but one that is weighted towards delivery.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en1" id="ch07_enx1">1</a></span> Rather than being primarily organized around functional efficiency and responsibility, the structure fundamentally starts with the product and the customer and works backwards from there. The product owners, for example, work with each Squad to capture and articulate the vision for what they are doing, support prioritization of the backlog, and ensure that outputs are fulfilling customer needs but the teams have the autonomy to decide how best to do the work.</p>
<p class="text">This model has become more widely known and copied but it is important to recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to what a good agile structure looks like. Spotify, like every other organization that has implemented agile structures, iterated its way towards this model, learning as it went. There are, however, some essential rules of thumb for agile structures that are key to bear in mind:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Keep the core team small:</span> some teams may be dealing with high levels of complexity but it is critical that no agile team gets beyond the ‘two pizza’ rule that I mentioned earlier in the book. No more than 10 people in a team.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Group together Squads into logical areas:</span> once the numbers of Squads increase beyond a few, grouping them together helps mitigate challenges around alignment, coordination and interdependencies. Spotify groups Squads into Tribes but no Tribe gets larger than around 150 people. There is some scientific basis for why this should be the maximum – anthropologist Robin Dunbar has proposed that there is a cognitive limit to the number of people with whom a person can maintain stable social relationships of around 150 (known as the Dunbar Number). Agile teams may be grouped together into areas defined by product (as with Spotify), other propositions (customer journeys), job-to-be-done (teams working on strategic challenges, teams working on innovation, teams working on product), or even types of work (explore, execute, extend and exploit).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Manage resourcing in a fluid way:</span> as the work that teams do evolves, it may well be necessary to swap people in and out of teams as the need arises to ensure that there are the most appropriate people working on <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-202" role="doc-pagebreak" title="202"/>outputs. This requires a much greater degree of fluidity around resourcing than would happen in a hierarchical environment, and adept management of talent.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Manage interdependencies:</span> as the number of teams scale, managing the interdependencies between the work that the teams are doing is critical – setting up technology infrastructure and testing processes that enable multiple teams to be working concurrently on product without interfering with what the other teams are doing. Leadership and oversight, documentation and key meeting frequency also all help.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Establish productive links with the rest of the business:</span> in the early stages of introducing agile teams the key job will be to create enough space to enable a different way of working, and to protect the new culture. As agile teams are scaled, the need to integrate the two sides of the dual operating system takes on more significance. I’ll discuss this more in the next section.</p></li>

<header><h1 class="title" epub:type="title" id="ch07_h1_002">CASE STUDY <span class="emphasis">Scaling Agile at ING Bank</span></h1></header>
<p class="text-fo">ING has reinvented its organization at group headquarters in the Netherlands (comprising 3,500 staff) from the ground up, moving from a traditional organizational model featuring functional departments such as marketing, IT and Product Management, to a completely agile model that shares much in common with the Spotify example. ING started with the group headquarters to show that you could begin with the core and set an example to the rest of the business. It was a transformation that took place over a multiyear period but instead of organizing around functional departments ING staff are now organized into about 350 nine-person Squads and 13 Tribes.</p>
<p class="text">The Squads are small multidisciplinary teams (no more than nine people) that are co-located and operate with a high degree of autonomy. Each Squad is focused on a specific client-related objective for which it has end-to-end responsibility (for example, an end-to-end customer journey) and may include marketing, data and analytics, design, UX, product and technology expertise. A product owner is responsible for coordinating the activities of the Squad and managing the backlog and priorities, but the product owner is a squad member rather than leader. As the mission evolves, the team and the functions that are represented evolve with it. As the mission is completed, the team is dissolved.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-203" role="doc-pagebreak" title="203"/>Squads that have interconnected missions or related business and customer propositions (for example, all Squads focused on mortgages) are grouped together into Tribes, and these tend not to exceed 100 to150 people. A Tribe lead helps coordinate priorities, budgets, manage interdependencies and is the interface with other Tribes to ensure alignment and knowledge sharing. Each Tribe also has an Agile coach to support high performance. Functional expertise and learning is supported through cross-squad Chapters, and a Chapter lead effectively represents hierarchy for the Chapter, particularly in terms of performance management, staffing and personal development.</p>
<p class="text">This approach has not only improved time-to-market, but increased productivity and employee engagement. Apart from the level of exceptional commitment to agile working and resourcing, there are a number of aspects of this that are particularly notable:<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en2" id="ch07_enx2">2</a></span></p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">When ING began the transformation there was no financial imperative to do so since the company was actually doing well at the time, but ING recognized that changing consumer behaviours and expectation could soon create significant challenges if it didn’t become more agile.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">ING recognized that it was not a linear transition, but about becoming a different type of organization that is itself characterized by continuous change. As Chief Operating Officer Bart Schlatmann has said: ‘Transformation is not just moving an organization from A to B, because once you hit B, you need to move to C, and when you arrive at C, you probably have to start thinking about D.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en3" id="ch07_enx3">3</a></span></p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">The reorganization is focused on minimizing obvious barriers to agility like bureaucracy and functional handovers but also on greater empowerment and autonomy to enable teams to move fast. Technology was organized around more frequent release cycles of two to three weeks rather than five or six times a year.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">The fact that each Squad is focused end to end on a particular customer objective, a common definition of success and includes all the key functions needed to create value means that this is a structure that is genuinely customer-centric.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">The new organization is supported by a new agile performance-management model. Instead of a manager’s salary and status being based on how much resource he or she controls, it is now focused far more on how the manager deals with knowledge and delivers outputs.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">There was a staged approach to the reorganization – it began with a compelling vision about what the business could be, and drew learnings from a pilot incorporating five or six Squads. Implementation involved a revamp of the working environment to support better meeting spaces, retrospectives, larger gatherings and whiteboards.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-204" role="doc-pagebreak" title="204"/>Support functions such as HR, finance, call centres, IT infrastructure and risk have not initially been included in the Squads but have instead adopted agile working practices in different ways.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">ING has been focused as much on getting the culture right as it has on the structure, spending a lot of time and energy focused on role-modelling the right behaviours (customer-centricity, empowerment, ownership) to support change. One example of this is a complete revamp of the onboarding programme, which not only involves new employees moving around the business to generate informal networks and learning, but every employee spending a week in the call centre taking customer calls.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Meeting structure and governance – most meetings are informal, with formal ones kept to a minimum. Each Squad has a clear written purpose for what it is working on, and an agreed way to measure the impact it has on customers, but has autonomy to prioritize and manage its daily activities. Mechanisms such as portfolio wall planning, scrums and standups ensure that the product owners within each Tribe keep the Squads aligned. Quarterly Business Reviews (QBR) involve each Tribe notating what it achieved over the quarter, its biggest learning (from both successes and failures), its objectives for the next quarter and what it will need from other Tribes. These QBR documents are openly available to support transparency.</p></li></ol>
<p class="text-fo">The new structure has enabled ING to dramatically improve speed-to-market through more frequent releases and increase the rate of innovation to help position it as the primary mobile bank in the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="text">But it is the level of commitment to agile resourcing that is truly impressive, avoiding the common trap of adopting some agile attributes but not letting go of legacy structures, processes or governance. Bart Schlatmann (who was the COO throughout the transformation) talks of the importance of having a clear vision for the agile transformation, and being clear about what you are willing to give up:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote">It requires sacrifices and a willingness to give up fundamental parts of your current way of working – starting with the leaders. We gave up traditional hierarchy, formal meetings, over-engineering, detailed planning, and excessive ‘input steering’ in exchange for empowered teams, informal networks, and ‘output steering’. You need to look beyond your own industry and allow yourself to make mistakes and learn. The prize will be an organization ready to face any challenge.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en4" id="ch07_enx4">4</a></span></p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">A great example of real agile transformation.</p>

<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-205" role="doc-pagebreak" title="205"/>Scaling stages</h3>
<p class="text-fo">As I’ve mentioned there is no one end result to agile transformation. No one blueprint for an agile organizational structure. No one roadmap for change. It’s notable that ING took an iterative, staged approach to its transformation and the secret really is to <span class="emphasis">be</span> agile about how you <span class="emphasis">become</span> more agile and learn and iterate. But we can draw out some key structural stages that organizations are most likely to pass through on their journey towards becoming truly agile:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Stage one:</span> start small by aligning a few small, agile teams to new challenges, propositions, or customer-focused objectives. The objective of this stage should be to learn as much as possible about what works and what is right for the contexts of your organization. Teams might be aligned to strategic problems, innovation tasks or customer journeys but the leadership team needs to understand the context for how small teams can best support real change. Teams will be staffed by change agents and pioneers. Fluidity and adaptability are key since teams may need to be realigned, but look for learnings that can support scalability. An appropriate leader/team of senior leaders (with a strong connection to the board) oversee direction and progress and ensure that the networked agile teams are given the support, autonomy and space that they need, and that new ways of working are not suffocated (<a href="#ch07_fig_002">Figure 7.2</a>).</p></li>

<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Hierarchy: Starting from the bottom, multiple members together form multiple teams.

</figure>
<ol class="list-number" start="2"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-206" role="doc-pagebreak" title="206"/>Stage two:</span> by this stage, the business will have a better understanding of the opportunity to align and use small agile teams in service of strategic challenges and change, so this is about scaling in sensible ways. It might be, for example, that the business has understood the value of aligning agile teams to end-to-end customer journeys and can now scale that approach. The learning and adaptation do not stop, but a key part of the change at this point is ensuring that there is wider adoption and understanding of agile principles and culture right across the organization. It’s also critical that as the networked side of the business scales it is not seen as entirely separate – there needs to be great communication and a good connection back to the business as usual so that the wider organization can learn, but also to ensure a flow of staff as needed from one side to the other (<a href="#ch07_fig_003">Figure 7.3</a>).</p></li>

<ol class="list-number" start="3"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Stage three:</span> when the number of agile teams reaches the point when alignment becomes challenging, the Squads will need to be grouped together (for ease, we can call these groupings Tribes, but this does not have to follow the Spotify model).

<p class="text-fo">It may well be that eventually there will be a stage four to this model, where the entire organization is structured into groups of small, agile squads but more likely there will remain some need for a more functional approach to some disciplines and managing business as usual. The proportions of the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-208" role="doc-pagebreak" title="208"/>business that are hierarchical and networked will change over time – an example would be the business that begins as 95 per cent hierarchy and 5 per cent networked, but then shifts to become more like 80 per cent and 20 per cent, and then adjusts back slightly because of a short- to medium-term context before reverting back to a more even balance owing to the need to evolve rapidly. So it is critical to continue learning and continue to be flexible in achieving the right balance. The point is that through adopting this approach a business is able to scale agile approaches in a way that mitigates risk and best suits its unique contexts. It’s the best way for the business to become truly ambidextrous and develop engines for exploration, execution, extension and exploitation.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch07_h2_002"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_052">Momentum for change (1): momentum = mass x velocity</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Agile transformation is not simply a matter of setting out a linear progression for change. It is about building momentum through adaptation and creating a flywheel effect where change can empower more change. It is about enabling scalability through standards and alignment combined with the autonomy to move fast: speed and scalability.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_004">Why momentum trumps speed alone</h3>
<p class="text-fo">In Lewis Carroll’s <span class="emphasis">Through the Looking-Glass</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en5" id="ch07_enx5">5</a></span> the Red Queen’s race sees Alice and the Queen running fast yet standing still. Alice decries the pointlessness of running without getting anywhere. In our country, she says, you run to get somewhere. ‘Now, here, you see,’ says the Queen, ‘it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!’</p>
<p class="text">Many businesses are caught in the Red Queen’s trap. In response to rapidly changing contexts they attempt to run faster and faster just to stay in the same spot. They demand longer working hours, make their people work harder, continuously shorten deadlines. But as long as you continue to work largely in the way that you have always worked, there will be a limit to the gains that you can make. Renowned management thinker Peter Drucker once wrote: ‘There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en6" id="ch07_enx6">6</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Velocity is speed with direction. We might celebrate moving quickly but we need to move quickly in the right way. But we also need mass to create <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-209" role="doc-pagebreak" title="209"/>momentum. In Physics, mass is both a property of a physical body and also a measure of its resistance to acceleration when a force is applied. So in order to create mass in transformation, we need to bring people on the journey with us, and create force for change through practice and cultural transformation, but we also need to reduce the drag on progress. We need to get the barriers and blockers to change out of the way. Once we have mass and velocity, we have speed, weight, direction, acceleration – we have momentum.</p>
<p class="text">Colonel John Boyd was a military strategist and something of a maverick. His analysis of air combat situations in the Korean War led to the origination of the OODA loop, a way of representing the benefits that can come from not just speed and force, but greater manoeuvrability. His proposals ran counter to a lot of contemporary military strategic thinking, which believed that US fighter planes had to be bigger, and fly higher, further and faster than their opposition to win in combat. Boyd’s Korean War analysis showed that the F-86 Sabre, which US pilots were flying, was disproportionately successful against the MiG15s being flown by the North Koreans, but also that the reason for this was not because the F-86 was a larger plane since it wasn’t, or that it could fly higher, further, faster since it couldn’t. The reason it won out was because it was more manoeuvrable.</p>
<p class="text">The OODA loop stands for ‘Observe, Orient, Decide, Act’ and recognizes the need for those on the frontline to always be taking account of latest contexts and inputs in a rapidly changing environment like the battlefield. Observation collects the necessary data and information inputs. Orientation turns this into an appreciation and understanding of position. Decision is the determination of a course of action. Action is the resultant activity.</p>
<p class="text">Boyd believed that intelligent organizations and organisms have a continuous cycle of interaction with their environment, which can enable adaptation. Advantage can come from moving through the cycle quicker than your opponent, thereby leaving him or her responding to dynamics that have already changed.</p>
<p class="text">This is a good metaphor for modern competitive advantage. Success comes not only from making smarter decisions but also from responding faster to changing situations. If a business can operate to a faster tempo it can become far more manoeuvrable. It’s no accident that sprint working using iterative methodologies like Agile can reduce time to market and improve speed of delivery, but we shouldn’t forget that one of the key advantages of this type of working is the ability to have learning and adaptation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-210" role="doc-pagebreak" title="210"/>built into the fabric of how we are working. If we can learn continuously and then successfully adapt and reprioritize on a frequent basis, we can embed not just speed, but greater manoeuvrability.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_005">Creating an organizational ‘flywheel’</h3>
<p class="text-fo">In order to create real momentum for change we need to create a self-perpetuating organizational flywheel that adds to the momentum with every additional exemplar of a new way of working in the business. There are several key tools and approaches from network thinking that we can utilize.</p>
<h4 class="head-c">POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS</h4>
<p class="text-fo">These are the kind of feedback loops where making a small change has a compounding effect. They enhance or amplify changes. A simple example of a positive feedback loop is a savings account that earns interest, which then generates interest on a larger amount. A startup may well look for positive feedback loops to support exponential rather than linear user growth through customer acquisition or engagement loops. A positive acquisition loop occurs, for example, when new users of a platform help to recruit other new users. A positive engagement loop can be triggered by mechanics that help ensure that user engagement promotes more user engagement, or in other words how customers’ use of a platform can encourage a higher level of use from other customers, which in turn supports even more use from other users.</p>
<p class="text">Similarly, positive feedback loops can also be created in innovation through the creation of a self-perpetuating innovation system where the efforts of one part of the business in the field empowers that of other groups, the wider business and even external operators. This is a key reason for teams to create reusable components and socialize their availability. Externalizing the good work that an organization is doing in an emerging field can make it more attractive for in-demand specialists to work there, which in turn can attract other specialists who want to learn and work with the best. In transformation we might also create positive feedback loops for behaviour in which small changes can create new habits that can generate real change in individuals but also wider groups.</p>
<h4 class="head-c">NETWORK EFFECTS</h4>
<p class="text-fo">I mentioned network effects in a couple of contexts earlier in the book. This is, of course, the principle that the value of a network is the square of the number of people on that network. Every additional user or node on the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-211" role="doc-pagebreak" title="211"/>network increases the value of the whole network. This is valuable to understand since these effects can generate greater value for marginal increase in cost. In a supply and demand marketplace like Airbnb, for example, cross-side network effects can support growth since the more supply there is (interesting places to stay) the more demand that generates, and the more demand there is the more likely landlords and hosts are to list their place on Airbnb. Same-side network effects mean that if I use Airbnb for the first time and am so impressed I tell my friends about the experience, then they are more likely to use the service too. So we get positive feedback loops much like we discussed above. But every additional place to stay and user on the network is increasing the value of the whole network and therefore Airbnb itself.</p>
<p class="text">In order to leverage network effects, we need to focus on network value, and how we can leverage mechanics that will increase that overall value. Network value is effectively the sum of the value to all users of the network, or the cost differential that would be there if the network didn’t exist (for example, Airbnb users paying extra for hotel rooms that weren’t located as conveniently, if Airbnb didn’t exist). So if we are building new networks that might include employees, partners, suppliers and other contributors in exchanges of information, capability or other value we need to think about total network value, and how we can create mechanics whereby every additional user on the network increases its overall worth to all. Strategies can be determined by what will have the highest impact on network value, and since revenue and other benefits typically lag behind network value, we can develop a more sophisticated understanding of potential future value.</p>
<h4 class="head-c">PLATFORM ECONOMICS</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Platforms typically facilitate efficient value exchange between multiple groups of users and players in an ecosystem. An example would be Spotify, which facilitates a relationship between artists, record companies, music lovers, and a whole range of services that have integrated with Spotify’s API. Platforms orchestrate and create shared common standards and might enable exchange of value between consumers and producers, or enable producers to create content that can be shared widely. The value comes from access, interaction and data but above all from learning. We might consider, for example, how we can externalize organizational capability through APIs and build platforms that can enable third parties to utilize services and capacity, thereby scaling our own learning.</p>
<p class="text-fo">Working together, these approaches can create a flywheel effect that can increase organizational momentum.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_006"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-212" role="doc-pagebreak" title="212"/>Scaling through standards</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Once momentum has been created it’s necessary to build on that forward energy by putting even more energy into the system and the change process. Charging agile teams with creating reusable components in the course of their work that can be used and repurposed by other teams and encouraging all teams to share code and other assets to minimize duplication of effort, is a simple way to allow agile teams to build off each other’s capabilities and catalyse progress. Another way is to create standards, manuals, guides and playbooks that can enable a universal approach, help teams to answer questions quickly, and socialize the best and fastest procedures. It’s one thing to move with speed. But we need to move fast with quality. Doing Agile doesn’t mean that we open ourselves up for unnecessary risk.</p>
<p class="text">A good set of standards can codify a way of working and scale positive behaviours fast. They are also key when people are moving from more traditional ways of working in helping the transition to be as smooth as possible. And they can help communicate to those teams that are not doing Agile what it really means and assure them that quality is embedded into the process. Standards can also help set performance at the right level. When the UK Government Digital Service created their ‘digital-by-default’ service standard and service manual in 2013 they (of course) put it online to make it universally accessible, but the objective of the standard was ultimately to make all government digital services so good that people would prefer to carry out the task online and each new service had to pass that simple standard.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en7" id="ch07_enx7">7</a></span> Interestingly, they also then took down all other existing standards pages from intranets and the internet to minimize confusion and nobody noticed. No one looks at a complicated, poorly written or designed standards documents so they need to be as accessible and well designed as possible. Good, widely available and well-understood standards should serve to minimize questions and demands on agile teams from the rest of the business – whilst agile teams should be able to assist the rest of the business in useful ways, their job is delivery and so anything that frees-up time for more of that is a good thing.</p>
<p class="text">One final thing on standards – avoid rule creep. It’s very easy (and very typical) for a set of rules to expand over time as new concerns or situations arise. The intention of the business in doing this is a good one –to mitigate risk and make sure that every scenario is covered. But, of course, what happens is that no one ever takes any rules out and so you end up with an unwieldy set of standards that serve to lock teams down and restrict options <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-213" role="doc-pagebreak" title="213"/>rather than free them up to do their best work. The unacknowledged consequence of this is that assessment of new work against these standards then becomes an unnecessarily long process involving too many people and the whole thing slows down.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_007">The importance of spend controls</h3>
<p class="text-fo">A renewed process for sensible spend controls should run alongside simple, accessible standards to ensure that things are done right but also that time, money and resource are not wasted. Spend controls are not exactly the sexiest part of digital transformation and so are not often discussed, yet they are absolutely critical.</p>
<p class="text">To begin with, it needs to be acknowledged that stopping projects that are not delivering is just as important in an agile business as starting new ones. This process needs to be freed from the blame, status and reputation impact that often goes with it. It’s no wonder that leaders stick with projects far beyond the time that they should really have been stopped when they become so invested in their success and the prospect of failure could well be seen as detrimental to their career. So setting up a process to review technology spend in sensible ways, and having the necessary power to stop projects that are clearly wasting resource, is essential. The team that runs this process has to have the requisite level of seniority but also credibility. The level of technology literacy amongst many senior leadership teams is woefully low, so don’t have people who have vested interests or particular agendas (favourite suppliers, for example) or who don’t know what they’re doing making critical decisions about critical capability.</p>
<p class="text">Staying with the UK Government Digital Service, the efficiency programme that ran alongside the ground-up redesign of a succession of high-transaction volume services cumulatively saved £50 billion in five years, savings that were mostly made from the running costs of government. Large organizations are particularly susceptible to wasting resource on huge technology projects that take multiple years to implement and fail to deliver on user needs or worse, are cancelled outright after a lot of money has been spent. Public institutions are no exception. The NHS National Programme for IT – a £12 billion project and the biggest civilian IT project of its kind anywhere ever for an organization with the largest workforce in Europe – was scrapped in 2011. The UK’s first e-Borders scheme which was started in 2003 set out to collect and analyse data on everyone travelling to and from the UK, but was cancelled after 11 years and an £830 million investment. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-214" role="doc-pagebreak" title="214"/>When GDS was asked by the Cabinet Office to run a technology transformation programme the service set out a broad set of guiding principles that combine an inherent focus on user need with built-in long-term flexibility to enable adaptation:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Start with user needs.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Design with choice and flexibility in mind.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Be transparent throughout.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Architect loosely coupled services, not a single system.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Favour short contracts.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Bring the best of consumer technology to the enterprise.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Make security as invisible as possible.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Build a long-term capability.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en8" id="ch07_enx8">8</a></span></p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">It’s common practice in large organizations for extremely expensive, multiyear, locked-in contracts to be awarded to large technology consultancies but this is far from always being the best way. GDS framed the principles as ‘technology at least as good as people have at home’ – a gloriously simple way of expressing what the technology <span class="emphasis">really</span> needs to look like.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_008">Where business meets customer need</h3>
<p class="text-fo">I’ve talked a lot in this book about genuinely working back from the customer and creating fast customer feedback loops to inform iterative creation of value. But where does customer need meet the needs of the business? To execute well, a truly agile organization needs to map customer-focused problem solving and innovation to business and product strategy in seamless but adaptive ways. If we think of the business goals and strategy as top-down, the bottom-up will be customer inputs that help to execute well, refine, inform and even challenge (<a href="#ch07_fig_005">Figure 7.5</a>).</p>
<figure aria-describedby="ch07_fig_005_details" class="figure" id="ch07_fig_005"><figcaption><p class="figure"><span class="label" epub:type="label"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-215" role="doc-pagebreak" title="215"/>Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">7.5</span> Business need meeting customer need in organizational strategy</p></figcaption><p class="figure-media"><img alt="A layered chart shows declining business needs and increasing customer needs balancing organizational strategy." src="images/M07NF005.jpg" title="Figure 7.5 Business need meeting customer need in organizational strategy"/></p>
<details id="ch07_fig_005_details">
<summary>Details</summary>
<p class="figure-alt-long">There are five layers in the illustration. The number of elements in each layer decreases as the layer goes up. Details of the strategy from bottom layer to the top layer are as follows:</p><ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Stories</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Epics</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Initiatives</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Business and product</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Business vision and goals</p></li></ul>
</details>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">The business vision and goals provide an overarching direction and are likely to change slowly. Out of that flows a business strategy that brings to life how the goals will be realized, and this can then be expressed through a product strategy. Out of the business and product strategy flow themes, areas of focus and initiatives – it is important not to overwhelm the business or create inefficiencies through too diverse a focus or with overlapping programmes (unless new initiatives are deliberately set up in competition with each other). Major projects and initiatives may well be managed through quarterly business reviews (QBRs), which can inform a backlog of Epics to be worked on by small, multidisciplinary Squads. The Squads create User Stories that express the Epics as customer value. Just as the strategy informs the themes and initiatives that in turn inform the Epics and User Stories, so the customer shapes the execution and informs the Epics, themes and strategy. One is top-down, the other is bottom-up, but they each flow up and down, informed by each other in order to deliver a business strategy in a customer-focused way.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_009">Alignment and measuring progress</h3>
<p class="text-fo">As the number of agile teams increases organizations need to guard against misalignment and also find ways to cascade strategy through the organization in inclusive, empowering ways that balance the need for team autonomy in moving fast with the need for everyone to go in the right direction. Having a strategy cascade that enables the happy confluence of organizational and customer strategy as we discussed in the previous section is key to this. Alignment should also come from governance and the oversight that the business creates for the agile teams whether that is through the Chief Digital Officer, the Tribe leads, or a ‘Digital Board’ that is comprised of senior directors and links oversight directly with the main board.</p>
<p class="text">Another key way to support alignment through the business is to use frameworks such as Objectives and Key Results (or OKRs). These involve setting quarterly objectives that are specific and measurable at a company, team and individual level. These objectives are then supported by quantifiable key results, against which performance is measured. Systems like <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-216" role="doc-pagebreak" title="216"/>OKRs are useful since everyone in the business has them from the CEO down (often they are made transparent for everyone to see, as they are at Google), we can use them to assess progress and performance, and they can align strategy with execution and measurement all the way down through the company. OKRs also have the benefit of making strategy at every level very clear, and agile teams and the people in them can be aligned around very specific objectives and measures, which helps ensure that activity that supports strategic objectives is prioritized. This is key when needing to change behaviour and implement a new strategy that can support transformation.</p>
<p class="text">Measuring progress can be tricky. There are typically many metrics that <span class="emphasis">could</span> be looked at but the challenge is deciding which ones <span class="emphasis">should</span> be looked at. To paraphrase the famous saying: not everything that can be counted counts. The measures that should count are those that are aligned to both user and business value. The UK Government Digital Service, for example, had four key measures aligned to the organization’s primary strategic objectives: getting more people to use online government services; building services that worked first time; saving money; and meeting user needs. To track progress against these they focused on four performance metrics: digital take-up; completion rate; cost per transaction; user satisfaction.</p>
<p class="text">Key metrics can be dashboarded to support transparency and access. GDS have public-facing dashboards covering 781 different government services and over a billion transactions a year.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en9" id="ch07_enx9">9</a></span></p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_010">Empowering aligned autonomy</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Greater autonomy, team and individual empowerment are powerful catalysts for adaptability. As I discussed earlier, high levels of autonomy mean faster decision-making, decisions being made closer to execution and customer feedback, and improved ability to pivot, respond quickly, or seize growth opportunities at speed. There is a high correlation between the degree of empowerment present in teams and how quickly the organization is able to make decisions and therefore its manoeuvrability.</p>
<p class="text">In slow-moving environments, it might work to have most of the decision-making power centralized at the top of the company but amongst rapidly shifting contexts the old idea of all the power residing at the top of the business and all the decisions flowing downwards is no longer fit for purpose. Instead, distributing authority more widely through the organization, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-217" role="doc-pagebreak" title="217"/>ensuring clarity about decision-making rights, setting clear expectations, deploying more agile forms of governance, and encouraging a culture of ownership can all support being more agile.</p>
<p class="text">Autonomy can counteract overburdensome bureaucracy and overly hierarchical control. If small, multidisciplinary teams or squads can act as the engine for transformation and change, then they need autonomy to iterate value properly, and have the kind of working culture and practices that enable them to move fast and be truly adaptive.</p>
<p class="text">The common challenge to this, though, is often focused around governance and alignment. If we have numbers of squads working with high levels of autonomy, how can we ensure they all go in the right direction? How can we make sure that interdependencies are managed properly? How can we make sure that they are working on the things that matter and avoid misdirection and poor governance? A fast-and-roughly-right mindset does not have to mean poor standards, inadequate quality, compromised requirements. Leaders need to let go, but they don’t need to let go of everything.</p>
<p class="text">The best framing for this is Spotify’s concept of ‘aligned autonomy’ which seeks to strike the right balance between high levels of autonomy and flexibility, and the need to marshal progress to make it all go in the same direction.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en10" id="ch07_enx10">10</a></span> Low autonomy and low alignment leads to misdirection and chaos. High autonomy but low alignment means that leadership is too removed from the work of the team. Low autonomy and high alignment results in leadership being too directive, and too much in the detail. Yet high autonomy combined with high alignment sets a clear direction and effectively frames the challenge to be addressed but facilitates velocity by enabling the team to decide how best to solve the problem.</p>
<p class="text">As we described earlier, Spotify aligns multiple small, multidisciplinary teams into Tribes in an arrangement that they have described as ‘loosely coupled, tightly aligned Squads’. The key is that there is a balance between the autonomy that the Squads need to move fast, and the alignment that is needed to ensure direction and governance. Working in agile, iterative ways need not mean a lack of either alignment or governance, but it does mean a shift in leadership style. Instead of hierarchically driven command and control style leadership, aligned autonomy requires leaders to frame the challenge in the way that teams can understand the problem/s that they need to solve. But the team decides how to solve the problem. This balance is key in achieving adaptiveness balanced with direction. Alignment enables true autonomy.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch07_h2_003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-218" role="doc-pagebreak" title="218"/><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_053">Momentum for change (2): mass = volume x density</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Agile transformation is nothing if we don’t bring our people on the journey. It will inevitably fail if we don’t create the environment that empowers, engages and motivates as many employees as possible to think differently and get things done. We need to create an organizational engine for curiosity, progress and high-velocity decision-making.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_011">Why, in transformation, the real battle is for hearts, not minds</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Earlier in the book I discussed how employee experience is often the poor relation to customer experience and technology focus in many transformation programmes. In agile transformation, bringing people on the journey with you is absolutely critical. As part of that discussion I mentioned the work that Gallup has done, demonstrating the appallingly low levels of employee engagement that exist across many companies, industries and countries. Gallup’s research shows that an amazing 87 per cent of employees worldwide are not engaged at work, but also that companies with highly engaged workforces outperform their peers by 147 per cent in earnings per share.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en11" id="ch07_enx11">11</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Lack of engagement can kill momentum for change just as surely as a directive from the CEO. You can’t expect change programmes to change anything if you don’t bring your people on the journey with you. Happy staff in touch with their end-users create exceptional customer experiences. Great employee engagement brings dividends in productivity and performance. The Gallup meta-analysis that I mentioned earlier in the book (covering more than 82,000 business units in 73 countries across 49 industries) found that for those business units that were in the top quartile of engagements, scores were 17 per cent more productive and 21 per cent more profitable than those in the bottom quartile. And yet we pay so little attention to it.</p>
<p class="text">Dan Cable, Professor of Organizational Behaviour at London Business School (and author of the book <span class="emphasis">Alive at Work</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en12" id="ch07_enx12">12</a></span>) has conducted extensive research focusing on the power of work environments that enable employees to bring their ‘best selves’ to work. People, he says, bring different things into the workplace. Some bring hands to do the work (where leaders write the script and come up with the game plan). Some bring brains (innovation, trying new things, emergent value). The heart (empathy, passion, desire to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-219" role="doc-pagebreak" title="219"/>make a difference) is perhaps the most difficult, yet is more important than ever – the ability to empathize well with customer need, to take risks to try new things, to be authentic when dealing with clients, is difficult to do when you’re not feeling it yourself. So it’s more critical than ever that we feel able to bring our whole self into the work environment.</p>
<p class="text">Yet this clearly isn’t happening in many workplaces. Dan quotes another stark statistic from an older Gallup survey that covered 1.7 million employees across 63 countries and 101 companies and which found that 80 per cent of people go to work to ‘shut off’ (in other words they hide their true selves).<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en13" id="ch07_enx13">13</a></span> Many of our working norms and practices come from an industrial age where standardization and replicability was what was required. In a modern era where creativity, problem solving and invention play a much bigger role, we need people to apply their unique strengths to tasks and problems, and we need them to feel like they don’t have to pretend to be something they’re not as soon as they get to work. We need more personalization of work.</p>
<p class="text">In the context of leadership, traditional hierarchically driven ideas about answers only existing at the seniormost levels of the organization gives way to leaders who are able to nurture the kind of environments in which answers can emerge. As Dan says: ‘The leader doesn’t have to have all the answers… you have to engage people to find the answers’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en14" id="ch07_enx14">14</a></span></p>
<p class="text">In the context of change, modern transformation should be less about the idea of fear-driven change from a ‘burning platform’, and more about missionaries and volunteers who can really catalyse positive change. Scripted calls to arms and motivation through fear creates rigidity. And in an age when adaptability is so key, investing in people who are truly able to be their best selves allows for the kind of flexibility needed to thrive. There are two dominant systems within our brains – the fear system and the seeking system. The former is based on cortisol and the response that we have to stressful situations, the latter is based on dopamine and is more a response to exploration, curiosity and play. When organizations create fear, that fear comes from within the group and so, just at the point when we most need different thinking and ideas, our response is to want to conform. Conformity is fine when you have the right rules but as Dan says: ‘there is no more important time to stimulate the right answer than when we don’t know the right answer’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en15" id="ch07_enx15">15</a></span> It’s all too easy for fear to dominate, and stifle the kind of creativity, exploration and energy we need to find those right answers and survive and thrive.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-220" role="doc-pagebreak" title="220"/>There are some simple hacks that Dan talks about as ways to encourage people to bring their whole selves to work including changing the onboarding process. He gives the example of some research they did with Wipro where enabling new employees to describe examples of when they’ve done their very best work made them 57 per cent less likely to quit, and also resulted in customers becoming 11 per cent happier. Greater engagement came from employees simply feeling that other people at work knew who they really were.</p>
<p class="text">But this is really about the environment that we enable as leaders and the type of leadership that allows for more personalized approaches. It’s impossible for change to happen if we don’t bring our staff on the journey with us. It’s impossible to bring our staff on the journey if they’re not engaged in their work and the direction that we’re taking. Transformation cannot happen without it. It’s time that we paid far greater attention to how we can truly change those Gallup figures. The future of your business depends on it.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_012">Valuing curiosity in business</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Curiosity is one of those qualities in business that most of us recognize as having value, yet few businesses actually do anything to recognize or support. Many organizations are in fact very efficient curiosity-killers, developing policies and ways of working that actively squash any inclination by their staff to explore. No one is given any time to dedicate to it; few have serious strategies in place to support it; the prioritization of the business acts against it. Author John Hagel has described how curiosity fundamentally conflicts with the scalable efficiency model that characterizes many large organizations yet will be key in enabling the shift towards scalable learning that I discussed earlier in the book.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en16" id="ch07_enx16">16</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Research conducted by behavioural scientist and Harvard Business School Professor Francesca Gino showed that out of 3,000 employees surveyed from a wide range of industries, only 24 per cent reported feeling curious in their jobs on a regular basis.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en17" id="ch07_enx17">17</a></span> Moreover, 70 per cent of respondents said that they face barriers to asking more questions at work.</p>
<p class="text">And yet there is a solid business case for the value of curiosity. Francesca Gino’s research has also shown that greater curiosity results in fewer decision-making errors (we’re more likely to think deeper about decisions and be less susceptible to confirmation bias or stereotyping) and more innovative approaches. Other research by her has indicated that when evaluating staff, natural curiosity in employees was associated by bosses with better job <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-221" role="doc-pagebreak" title="221"/>performance, and that curiosity helped people to be less defensive, to increase open communication and empathy, reduce group conflict and improve team performance. Work by Spencer Harrison, Associate Professor of Organizational Behaviour at INSEAD, has demonstrated that curiosity boosts creativity, even in relatively structured roles such as those in a call centre.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en18" id="ch07_enx18">18</a></span> In Francesco Gino’s 3,000 person survey 92 per cent of respondents regarded curiosity as a catalyst for motivation, job satisfaction, high performance and innovation.</p>
<p class="text">Yet it’s clear that the attitudes of leaders and employees often diverge. A large study by Spencer Harrison in collaboration with SurveyMonkey, which surveyed more than 23,000 people (including 16,000 employees and 1,500 C-Suite leaders), found that whilst 83 per cent of senior leaders said that curiosity is encouraged in their company ‘a great deal’ or ‘a good amount’, only 52 per cent of employees felt the same.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en19" id="ch07_enx19">19</a></span> An amazing 81 per cent of lower-level staff believed that curiosity made no material difference in their compensation.</p>
<p class="text">Clearly senior leaders in many organizations believe that they are supporting and encouraging this attribute when the reality is very different. It’s easy to talk about simplistic fixes like ‘be more curious’ and ‘give employees more time to explore’, but the answer needs to be more systematic than that.</p>
<p class="text">So that we might understand how to build systems and behaviour that can support and amplify curiosity we need to better understand the behaviour itself. Specifically, it is worth appreciating the different types of curiosity. Psychologist Daniel Berlyne (1954) famously distinguished between the different types of curiosity using two dimensions:<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en20" id="ch07_enx20">20</a></span></p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">diversive</span> (seeking stimulation from any source to avoid boredom, for example) versus <span class="strong">specific</span> (where we might be looking for a particular piece of information);</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">perceptual</span> (our liking for novel or new things) versus <span class="strong">epistemic</span> (our desire to grow our knowledge).</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">We might represent these dimensions (along with some examples of each type) on the matrix in <a href="#ch07_fig_006">Figure 7.6</a>.</p>
<figure aria-describedby="ch07_fig_006_details" class="figure" id="ch07_fig_006"><figcaption><p class="figure"><span class="label" epub:type="label"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-222" role="doc-pagebreak" title="222"/>Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">7.6</span> Dimensions of Curiosity</p></figcaption><p class="figure-media"><img alt="A chart shows dimensions of curiosity mapped as a graph with four quadrants.

<p class="text-fo">Since perceptual curiosity speaks to our desire for novelty it may well diminish the more we are exposed to the same stimuli but can help really motivate exploratory behaviour. Berlyne described epistemic curiosity as a drive aimed: ‘not only at obtaining access to information-bearing stimulation, capable of dispelling uncertainties of the moment, but also at acquiring knowledge’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en21" id="ch07_enx21">21</a></span></p>
<p class="text">This is our relentless appetite to understand and grow our knowledge. On the other dimension, we have the degree of information specificity where we might have a more general desire for mental stimulation or be after a particular piece of information. Our desire for information and understanding comes from how useful both these things can be to us, whether in the present or at some point in the future, and so curiosity is commonly thought of in terms of motivating learning. If there is a gap in our information knowledge, we therefore have a desire to fill it. US academic George Loewenstein described curiosity as: ‘a cognitive induced deprivation that arises from the perception of a gap in knowledge and understanding’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en22" id="ch07_enx22">22</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The information gap (<a href="#ch07_fig_007">Figure 7.7</a>) means that if we have a small amount of information about something we are motivated to find out more than if we know nothing or think we know a lot or everything. Information gaps exist between the knowledge that we currently have, and that which we want to have or think we need, effectively create a feeling of deprivation, which in turn motivates us to learn.</p>

<p class="figure-alt-long">Low curiosity with low knowledge is less information. As curiosity increases, knowledge level also increases. As knowledge increases more, curiosity drops down.</p>

</figure>
<p class="text-fo">Information gap theory is supported by a 2009 study conducted by Caltech researchers Min Jeong Kang and Colin Camerer who used fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) to identify the neural pathways of curiosity.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en23" id="ch07_enx23">23</a></span> They scanned 19 people whilst they were being presented with 40 trivia questions that had been selected to provide a diverse mixture of high and low specific/epistemic curiosity, and found that people were least curious when they had no idea about the answer or if they were extremely confident in their knowledge, and most curious when they had some idea about the idea but lacked confidence. This latter situation created a significant compulsion to want to know the answer.</p>
<p class="text">Curiosity is critical to intrinsically motivated learning, key to the development of capability and influential in how we make decisions. And as we discussed earlier, systematic learning at scale is essential to the agile, forward-thinking business. So, building on this understanding of how curiosity works, we can define a set of leadership behaviours that can embed this critical trait into team and organizational culture.</p>
<p class="text">Let’s start with the importance of questions, and how those that leaders ask of their teams and staff can be key in stimulating greater curiosity. In the rush to deliver, execute and solve problems, for example, do we ever really pause to ask whether we’re actually asking the right questions? Rather than spending all our time thinking hard about answers, perhaps we should spend more time thinking harder about the question that we are actually asking. Have we framed the problem in the right way? Are we solving the right problem? It has never been truer to say that great leaders ask great questions. Kevin Kelly, in his book <span class="emphasis">Th</span><span class="emphasis">e Inevitable</span> has described how good questions cannot be answered immediately, challenge existing answers, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-224" role="doc-pagebreak" title="224"/>create new territory of thinking, are the seed of innovation: ‘A good question cannot be predicted. A good question will be the sign of an educated mind. A good question is one that generates many other good questions. A good question may be the last job a machine will learn to do. A good question is what humans are for.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en24" id="ch07_enx24">24</a></span></p>
<p class="text">And how do we respond when we get asked the questions by the team? If we think we know the answer or have an opinion on the subject a leader’s typical response is always to just hand the answer down and move on. But is the team member learning anything in that process? What happens if we ask a question back or challenge them to find the answer themselves? Children have been found to ask an average of 73 questions a day.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en25" id="ch07_enx25">25</a></span> They have natural curiosity that peaks around the age of four. Studies have shown that children use questioning as a way to explore gaps or inconsistencies in knowledge.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en26" id="ch07_enx26">26</a></span> Yet it has also been shown that parents can foster ongoing curiosity in their children by modelling a love of learning, trying new things and responding to their offspring’s questions with more questions that encourage exploration. It is therefore important that leaders model the right learning behaviours, and create a culture of exploration by asking follow-up questions and build questions. Leaders shouldn’t always feel that they have to answer every question brought to them in the interests of expediency. Why not ask the employees in return how they are proposing to find the answer themselves and challenge them with another relevant, follow-on question.</p>
<p class="text">If the information gap tells us that people are more curious when they have partial knowledge about something, then leaders can support curiosity by encouraging the team to learn at the edges of their domains of expertise. To explore at the edges of what they know. Simple techniques such as involving people in projects that are stretching and put them outside of their core comfort zone can help this. Novel experiences, or conflicting or ambiguous information can all stimulate more curiosity so create situations where team members can learn from unusual or non-typical sources.</p>
<p class="text">In her work around experience design, researcher Shih-Mei Lee has described how we develop the desire to understand and explore in ways that are sociable, embodied and playful.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en27" id="ch07_enx27">27</a></span> In other words, sociability curiosity allows us to create social bonds through naturally learning from others. Embodied curiosity speaks to how we learn through our senses. And playfulness can support self-directed exploration by lowering the fear of failure. Leaders can proactively create situations that enable the opportunity for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-225" role="doc-pagebreak" title="225"/>employees to learn from others through group learning and exploration sessions. They can support regular defined times in the week when team members can explore and work, play with ideas and experiment (like the Andrei Geim and Kostya Novoselov graphene example that we mentioned earlier in the book). Spencer Harrison’s work has shown the value of encouraging individuals to bring their interests with them into the workplace and share them. It creates a sense of identity but also prompts others to explore more.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en28" id="ch07_enx28">28</a></span> Leaders that create environments that naturally enable people to be themselves and do their best work, but also give them space to explore, can truly amplify curiosity in their teams.</p>
<p class="text">As well as demonstrating the information gap and that specific epistemic curiosity is linked to seeing information and the resolving of that gap as a reward, Min Jeong Kang and Colin Camerer’s study also showed that memory formation was stronger if people were curious but hadn’t necessarily got the answer right the first time. Exploration and experimentation therefore enhance the potential for real learning, so leaders should encourage more of it, and support learning from both successes and failures.</p>
<p class="text">And finally, one of the most effective ways of successfully embedding learning is to teach others what we know. US theoretical physicist Richard Feynman originated a technique for learning that involved teaching a concept that you want to understand more to others (he actually suggested children were the best audience), reviewing the gaps in the knowledge that you become aware of, going back to the source material, organizing and simplifying it, and perhaps even teaching it again.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en29" id="ch07_enx29">29</a></span> The ability to convey a concept to other people is a good test of your knowledge of that concept. As US philosopher Mortimer Adler once said: ‘The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.’</p>
<p class="text">Curiosity is not a luxury, it is essential.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_013">The relevance paradox</h3>
<p class="text-fo">In the modern business environment, it is surely more valuable than ever to encourage and look for inputs from as broad a range of sources as possible. It’s very easy to get stuck in a focus that seeks answers and examples from contexts that are very close to the ones we know – solutions or best practice from inside our own sector or industry, for example. Yet there is huge value in applying a bit more imagination – looking for solutions that may seem <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-226" role="doc-pagebreak" title="226"/>unrelated or far outside of our known territory, but which have similar contexts and so can reveal truly innovative answers.</p>
<p class="text">When NASA scientists were developing the first space suits, they began in the obvious way by adapting the high-altitude pressure suits that had been worn by aircraft pilots. As the space programme matured and the requirements of the suits became more sophisticated, however, NASA realized that it needed to develop something altogether more bespoke. A particular challenge was presented in the Apollo programme by the need to be able to walk on the moon. Having a fully enclosed suit whilst still enabling maximum mobility proved to be a tricky challenge. NASA engineers spent a fortune trying unsuccessfully to develop complex knee joints in the suits that would enable smooth movement whilst still being fully enclosed and structurally strong.</p>
<p class="text">Eventually, in 1962 one of the companies working on this technical challenge, Garrett AiResearch, was directed by the New York Metropolitan Museum to the Tower of London. The Met had pointed out that a suit of tournament armour made for Henry VIII to use in 1520 at the Field of the Cloth of Gold had been designed specifically for foot combat rather than horseback, and so might provide the answer that they were looking for. When the Tower of London sent pictures of the suit of armour to the Garrett AiResearch and NASA teams, they saw that the joint was made from seamlessly overlapping plates of steel that left no gaps but allowed freedom of movement. The suit of armour provided the key inspiration for critical parts of the space suit that would allow Neil Armstrong to take his first steps on the moon.</p>
<p class="text">One NASA engineer reportedly commented that it would have saved them a lot of time and investment had they looked at the armour earlier, but the team fell victim to a common problem – the relevance paradox. This occurs simply when individuals or groups are unaware of critical information that would help them make better decisions but in being unaware of it they don’t see its relevance and so carry on in ignorance. We usually only seek advice or information that we think we need to solve a problem and fail to question whether we have as full an appreciation of that information as we should. Once again, taking the broadest inputs, applying imagination and being open to challenge is key to solving problems in an agile business well. This means opening the business up to fresh perspectives, similar contexts from other industries, and the challenge that can come from new employees who question existing entrenched practices or habits.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_014"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-227" role="doc-pagebreak" title="227"/>Building momentum for change: the progress principle</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Sprint working can be a powerful driver of both rapid organizational learning and strategic adaptability but done right it can not only create new value and be applied in the creation of new products and services but can also support far wider organizational change and be used to find a way through key business challenges, and reorient the business towards heightened levels of experimentation. As we’ve discussed earlier, learning and continuous improvement are embedded in the fabric of this working methodology, not least in the regular retrospectives that are conducted at the end of each sprint. Flexibility and adaptation are too, in the regular reprioritization of the backlog of jobs to be done. As continuous learning generates improved ways of getting stuff done and achieving key goals, sprint working can support growing organizational momentum towards an overarching vision or objective.</p>
<p class="text">But there is something else about sprint working, another way in which it can contribute to building momentum for change, that is less often discussed – it’s role as an inclusive, motivating, energy-generating way of working. There are a number of reasons for this but a particularly powerful one is that this way of working can make the value that the team is delivering very visible and very tangible and making progress tangible is a key principle of building momentum for organizational agility and change.</p>
<p class="text">Teresa Amabile, Professor in the Entrepreneurial Management Unit at Harvard Business School, has described this as the ‘progress principle’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en30" id="ch07_enx30">30</a></span> At the heart of this concept is a simple, but very compelling idea – the power of progress: ‘Of all the things that can boost emotions, motivation, and perceptions during a workday, the single most important is making progress in meaningful work. And the more frequently people experience that sense of progress, the more likely they are to be creatively productive in the long run.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en31" id="ch07_enx31">31</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Amabile’s extensive workplace research based on thousands of daily surveys has shown that above more visible and extrinsic rewards and incentives, a key driver of creative and productive performance is the quality of what she calls a person’s ‘inner work life’, or that mix of emotions, motivations and perceptions experienced over the course of a work day: ‘how happy workers feel; how motivated they are by an intrinsic interest in the work; how positively they view their organization, their management, their team, their work, and themselves.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en32" id="ch07_enx32">32</a></span></p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-228" role="doc-pagebreak" title="228"/>A positive inner work life, characterized by these qualities, is fundamental in enabling higher levels of achievement, commitment and even collaboration. When the researchers looked at the triggers that shaped how positive this inner work life was on any given day, it was meaningful progress (however large or small) made by the individual or team that was the key determinant. Setbacks against progress created a negative inner work life. Surrounding this were ‘catalysts’ (those actions that directly support work) and ‘nourishers’ (including encouragement, respect or recognition) that contributed towards positive emotions. ‘Inhibitors’ (things that negate progress) and ‘toxins’ (things that discourage or undermine) had the opposite effect.</p>
<p class="text">This makes intuitive sense, and yet so much in the workplace seems designed to inhibit or discourage. Waterfall processes can often involve lengthy time periods where work is done but with limited visible signs of value (particularly value for the end-users) being generated. It is often characterized by large project teams that become unwieldy and difficult to move forwards at pace. How often have we stepped away from a project and returned later only to find that nothing has really moved on from where we left it? Sprint working is not a panacea, but the point about it is that it is designed around tangible, visible progress. Releasing early and often. Tracking velocity against goals. Reprioritizing based on learning.</p>
<p class="text">At the simplest level, workflow visualization tools such as Kanban boards are an example of making work velocity and progress visible. Designed to optimize the flow of a team’s work, they enable everyone in the team to immediately see what work is underway, and also to see progress being made in value and outputs as elements of the backlog move across to the right (<a href="#ch07_fig_008">Figure 7.8</a>).</p>

<p class="text-fo">It’s easy to dismiss these tools as tactics that belong in technology or product teams but there are important principles at work here. It is key that we find better ways for everyone in the business to see the progress that they, the team, and the organization are making. It’s easy when we spend our days in meetings and e-mail to lose sight of the forward trajectory that we’re actually on. It’s very demotivating to get to the end of a busy week and feel as though we’ve not actually accomplished much at all. This requires leadership to find more tangible ways of communicating progress towards well-understood goals, but also tools to be made available to support the visibility of team progress.</p>
<p class="text">Building on this and as I discussed earlier, it is important for leaders to find more tangible ways of connecting staff to the impact that they are making. Author and academic Adam Grant conducted a well-known study focused on just this point.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en33" id="ch07_enx33">33</a></span> He studied a group of telemarketing fundraisers who were raising money to provide student scholarships. The annual turnover rate in the call centre where the fundraisers worked was 400 per cent.</p>
<p class="text">Grant brought in a student who had been a recipient of one of the scholarships to talk to the workers about how much the scholarship had changed his life and how grateful he was for the work that the fundraisers did. After that meeting the average amount of money that the call centre workers raised rose by 142 per cent and the average number of minutes that they spent on the phone went up by 171 per cent. In a similar vein, when Grant positioned a picture of the patient alongside an X-ray for radiologists, diagnostic accuracy went up by 43 per cent.</p>
<p class="text">The principle at play here is the power of connecting people with the impact of the work that they are doing. As Grant says: ‘Very often we do work that matters to some group of people, but we’re really left disconnected from knowing what is the real consequence.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en34" id="ch07_enx34">34</a></span></p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-230" role="doc-pagebreak" title="230"/>Connecting staff with impact increases not only motivation but also engagement and resilience, and so it remains an undervalued yet powerful tool for leaders. Simple ways to deliver this include getting more staff in front of customers, enabling employees to be part of customer feedback processes, connecting work to the impact on progress towards goals, and making the results of customer/supplier/partner impact or feedback far more visible. We have to find better ways to make progress more tangible and to connect employees to the consequences of the work that they are doing. Such a positive sense of progress can be a powerful catalyst to generating momentum.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_015">Getting things done in large organizations</h3>
<p class="text-fo">It is amazing in large organizations, in spite of all the talent, will and intelligence surrounding us, how difficult it can be to get (new) initiatives off the ground. Sometimes it almost feels as though the company is set up to thwart people who want to create something new and different.</p>
<p class="text">In 1944 the predecessor to the CIA, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) created a 32-page <span class="emphasis">Simple Sabotage Field Manual</span> for use by its agents and citizen-saboteurs in the Second World War.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en35" id="ch07_enx35">35</a></span> Alongside recommendations around physical interventions, the manual included a series of suggestions for more indirect but no less damaging sabotage through means such as poor decision-making in organizations and obstructing progress through overburdensome bureaucracy. This list of sabotage tactics (paraphrased here) that might be deployed in meetings and elsewhere, unfortunately reads like a list of what can so easily happen every day in large organizations:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Insist on doing everything through ‘channels’.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Make ‘speeches’. Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your ‘points’ by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">When possible, refer all matters to committees, for ‘further study and consideration’. Attempt to make the committees as large as possible – never fewer than five.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Haggle over precise workings of communications, minutes or resolutions.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to reopen the question of the advisability of that decision.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-231" role="doc-pagebreak" title="231"/>Advocate ‘caution’. Be ‘reasonable’ and urge your fellow conferees to be ‘reasonable’ and avoid haste, which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Be worried about the propriety of any decision – raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en36" id="ch07_enx36">36</a></span></p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">In contrast, Thomas Kalil, who was Deputy Director for Policy in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy during the Obama administration, wrote an excellent paper on getting things done in large organizations.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en37" id="ch07_enx37">37</a></span> He emphasized strategies including having an agenda rather than reacting to the agenda of others, making it easy for people to help you, working from the top-down and bottom-up, finding and recruiting allies, asking interesting questions to help solicit ideas or help, using standing meetings effectively, and thinking of the end at the beginning to ensure good outcomes. To help onboard new members of the team, he created a ‘Team Kalil whiteboard’, which carried a succinct list of principles that condenses these broader strategies into a punchy and useful checklist.</p>
<p class="text">The list also included points relating to ownership:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Steer; don’t row.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Have an opinion.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">If you had 15 minutes to pitch POTUS, what is on your list and are you working on it?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Strong relationships are built on trust, mutual understanding and reciprocity.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">It included missives focused on action and productivity:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Hours you contribute/Hours overall.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Entrepreneur = someone not limited by the resources directly under his or her control.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Find your doers.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Better to light a single candle than cry out in the darkness.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Don’t be a bottleneck.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">And missives relating to direction, organization and collaboration:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-232" role="doc-pagebreak" title="232"/>Write it down. Make it happen.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Schedule is your friend.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Think of the end at the beginning.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">If you want people to do something, make it easy.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">You can get more done if you don’t care who gets the credit.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en38" id="ch07_enx38">38</a></span></p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">There are some clear themes from this simple checklist that speak well to overcoming some of the common obstacles to getting things done in complex environments: the importance of ownership; starting small and making progress however limited; being resilient; the power of influence; direction and governance.</p>

<header><h1 class="title" epub:type="title" id="ch07_h1_003">CASE STUDY <span class="emphasis">ANZ Bank</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="text-fo">ANZ Bank is a great example of combining the need to change leadership mindset with a new, scaled approach to agile structures. Motivated by a need to increase the speed with which it creates measurable customer value, to break down silos and inefficient functional hand-offs, and a desire to reinvent itself as a great place to work and be competitive in the battle for talent, ANZ Bank’s agile transformation has focused on two key strands of work, which the organization has called New Ways of Leading (NWOL) and New Ways of Working (NWOW).<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en39" id="ch07_enx39">39</a></span> The former has focused on five key leadership behaviours:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Be curious</span> – curiosity is seen as a fundamentally powerful tool in the information era.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Create shared clarity</span> – each team member should be able to explain simply the collective purpose of the team.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Empower people</span> – working through others as well as yourself.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Connect with empathy</span> – human bonding and empathy as a motivator to do better work.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Grow people selflessly</span> – sharing power and developing people to do their best work.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">Alongside new leadership behaviours ANZ implemented a programme to transform ways of working. The business asked 9,000 people, from the senior leadership team down, to reapply for their jobs, as a signal that the business was serious about change but also a chance to deliberately select people that reflected the new <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-233" role="doc-pagebreak" title="233"/>behaviours for a new agile organization. The business made significant cuts to staffing as part of the transformation but to support transparency in the process it ran the programme from a glass room called ‘the fishbowl’, which anyone could enter and look at what was happening, and ran twice weekly pizza sessions with 70 people at a time to give updates and answer questions. Not only does ANZ now have more than 9,000 people working in agile teams but, according to General Manager of Omnichannel Christian Venter, is accomplishing the same amount of work with 20 to 30 per cent less people. Small, multidisciplinary teams or Squads are tightly focused on specific customer objectives, and 20 to 30 Squads are grouped together into Tribes, which are focused on proposition areas. Some specific functions, such as compliance, for example, had a dedicated person for each Tribe rather than one in every Squad.</p>
<p class="text">The transformation has not come without difficulties and new emergent challenges. New ways of working soon began to clash with old ways of funding projects, for example. Traditional methods of budgeting, which worked on annual cycles and/or a project basis, struggled to absorb the cost of change needed with iterative, agile working.</p>
<p class="text">The UK Government faced a similar challenge in its transformation. Traditional approaches to project funding involve writing a business case and fixing the time period for investment.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en40" id="ch07_enx40">40</a></span> This kind of upfront specification very quickly creates problems when working iteratively on complicated and potentially unpredictable development projects resulting in friction between the teams doing the work and those that are agreeing the budgets, which simply slows everything down. Linear funding models assume nothing or little will change and so ensure that the cost of adaptation is high.</p>
<p class="text">In addition, the costs in establishing a new team or stepping down an existing one is rarely taken into account in funding proposals. Difficulties in adapting to changing circumstances mean that senior stakeholders and approvals boards end up making decisions about even relatively minor changes to funding or development. Giving the teams that are doing the work greater autonomy to make product or development decisions keeps those decisions with the people who are closest to the work (and often the customer), but also frees-up senior time to focus on broader strategic aspects and governance.</p>
<p class="text">Taking approaches that are more aligned to the innovation accounting approach from Lean Startup that I mentioned earlier in the book allows for greater flexibility and adaptability and can effectively enable investment in teams and progress along a pipeline of work rather than inflexible investment in individual projects.</p>

<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_016"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-234" role="doc-pagebreak" title="234"/>Agile meetings</h3>
<p class="text-fo">As well as challenging the defaults around operating norms such as meetings, we can actively work to make gatherings shorter and smarter to not only create space and move quicker but also to improve the working environment (and perhaps protect the sanity of our employees whilst we’re at it).</p>
<p class="text">Meetings are a necessary tool to help any business run effectively, but they can also be a demotivating time suck. When salary data business <a href="http://Salary.com"><span class="url-hyperlink">Salary.com</span></a> surveyed more than 3,200 people in 2012, the biggest waste of time in the workplace was perceived to be too many meetings (this was named by 47 per cent of respondents and was followed by dealing with office politics, which was cited by 43 per cent).<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en41" id="ch07_enx41">41</a></span></p>
<p class="text">A 2018 study of 19 million meetings conducted by scheduling service Doodle (which also involved 6,500 employee interviews) found that the most irritating waste of time, identified by 89 per cent of participants, was ineffective or poorly organized meetings.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en42" id="ch07_enx42">42</a></span> More than two-thirds of those surveyed said that they lost time every week due to unnecessary or cancelled meetings. The cost of those poorly organized meetings was estimated to be almost US $400 billion in the United States alone.</p>
<p class="text">Dr Steven Rogelberg, Professor at the University of North Carolina (and the author of <span class="emphasis">The Surprising Science of Meetings: How</span> <span class="emphasis">you can lead your team to peak performa</span><span class="emphasis">nce</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en43" id="ch07_enx43">43</a></span>), has conducted extensive research into meetings over 15 years and thousands of employees in different companies, demonstrating the significant upside of improving how meetings are run both for the business and the employee. His research has shown, for example, that meetings are better if they are kept small and not subject to ‘meeting bloat’. Having people attend who do not contribute or are unnecessary observers is counterproductive. A 2010 Bain &amp; Company study, for example, showed that for each additional person over seven members in a decision-making group, decision effectiveness is reduced by approximately 10 per cent. The rule is simple – no hangers on.</p>
<p class="text">Typically, says Rogelberg, the leader of the meeting is the one who ends up leaving it happiest, so he suggests rotating meeting leads as a way to maintain and improve effectiveness over time, and to challenge the ‘manager’s schedule’ of hour-long blocks of meeting time. He suggests reducing an hour to a nominal length like 45 minutes as a way to introduce a slight urgency to the meeting to get decisions made.</p>
<p class="text">Perhaps an even more powerful way to challenge the defaults is to adopt Percolate’s ‘meetings should be 15 minutes by default’ rule that we discussed <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-235" role="doc-pagebreak" title="235"/>earlier in the book as a way to really break long-established habits. More regular short ‘huddles’, like a daily standup that an agile team might run, can often achieve as much as an hour-long status update meeting. A study recounted in the <span class="emphasis">Journal of Applied Psychology</span> in 1999 found that sit-down meetings last 35 per cent longer than those held standing up, with no gains in effectiveness.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en44" id="ch07_enx44">44</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Rogelberg stresses the benefits of having clear outputs required of the gathering, securing agenda inputs in advance and assigning ownership, and doing a pre-mortem to identify anything that might get in the way of good outcomes. It is notable just how many meetings spend disproportionate amounts of time on trivial items. Cyril Northcote Parkinson, who originated the law about work expanding to fill the time assigned for its completion, also created the ‘Law of Triviality’: ‘The time spent on any item of the agenda will be in inverse proportion to the sum (of money) involved.’</p>
<p class="text">Parkinson’s Law of Triviality can be explained by what has been termed the ‘bike-shed effect’ or ‘bikeshedding’ – the tendency for significant amounts of time to be wasted in corporate meetings by focusing on trivial issues that attendees know more about. Parkinson gives the fictional example of a committee charged with approving plans for a nuclear power plant spending the majority of their time discussing easier-to-grasp issues such as the materials to use for the staff bike shed. Since they know much less about nuclear power stations they talk about it briefly and then just approve the recommendation that has been put in front of them.</p>
<p class="text">We’ve all been in meetings where too much time is spent discussing trivial issues that people may know more about at the expense of time spent on more complex but important subjects. The term ‘bikeshedding’ is used most notably amongst the software engineering community but it describes a widespread phenomenon. As strategist Russell Davies has said: ‘The difference is that software people have identified and named the pattern. That naming is an organizational hack that allows them to break out of it and get on with something more useful.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en45" id="ch07_enx45">45</a></span></p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch07_h2_004"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_054">Momentum for change (3): velocity = speed + direction</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Efficacious agile transformation depends heavily on adaptive strategy and resourcing. It’s no good moving fast if we’re moving fast in the wrong direction, so continual reappraisal is needed to achieve the vision that has been set. A critical element in effective adaptation is making smarter decisions through data and avoiding the common pitfalls and bias that can misdirect us.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_017"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-236" role="doc-pagebreak" title="236"/>Using adaptive strategy and resourcing to keep fast and focused</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Earlier in this part of the book I discussed the value of sprint working in embedding learning (notably through regular review and retrospective) and adaptation (through reprioritizing of the backlog and sprint planning) into the fabric of how the organization is working. This can only have real value at an organizational level rather than just a team level if learning and prioritization is fed back up and taken into account to evolve wider product and business strategy. Just as a team uses a reprioritized backlog to reflect latest contexts, so the organization should use feedback loops to be more responsive to shifting dynamics. To do this well we need to get good at structuring, organizing, interpreting and actioning what data can tell us, but also be aware of some of the common biases that can easily skew interpretation and recognize the value of human-centred approaches such as getting in front of actual customers, the value of empathy, intuition and creativity. The point is that moving fast can build momentum only if we build-in regular adaptation to evolve the strategy of <span class="emphasis">how</span> we are achieving our vision.</p>
<p class="text">This response to shifting dynamics may be adaptive strategy but in order to truly capitalize on adaptive opportunity the agile business needs to manage resourcing in more fluid ways. It may, for example, need to spin up new small, multidisciplinary team/s to focus quickly on an emerging opportunity or explore a new strategic challenge. Operating at larger scale in small teams or Squads makes it easier to swap team members in and out of teams as required, but also to explore a new or challenging area at speed. Remember, small teams can drive big change, and rather than respond to perceived opportunity by immediately generating a large new business initiative there is the opportunity for a small agile team to work more quickly to begin creating some answers. In order to do this well we need to be prepared to allocate talent right across the explore, execute, extend and exploit spectrum.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_018">Being data-driven AND data-informed</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Data are, of course, of fundamental and existential value to businesses in the modern era. And yet so many organizations still seem to struggle to derive exceptional value from the copious data that they already have. Many futurists, conference speakers and commentators before now have used the phrase ‘data are the new oil’ as a way to express the heightened worth of data yet this suggests that data are something simply to mine and exploit in <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-237" role="doc-pagebreak" title="237"/>mechanical ways. Far better to acknowledge how we can not only be more data-driven in our decision-making but also <span class="emphasis">data-informed</span>.</p>
<p class="text">As something of an expert in extracting value from data Clive Humby, the founder of customer science business Dunnhumby, has spoken of how data are like oil in the sense that their true value is only realized when we refine the data, and change them into valuable entities that can drive profitable activity.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en46" id="ch07_enx46">46</a></span> If we fail to do this well, data can lead to wasteful or damaging courses of action or be subject to misreading through bias or inexperience. In other words, data may well be the new oil, but in the sense that they are toxic unless you refine them.</p>
<p class="text">The Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom (or DIKW) pyramid, long part of the language of information science, provides a useful strategic approach to not only understanding a hierarchy of value from data, but also the fundamental underlying capabilities that a truly agile business needs in order to thrive in a data-rich world (<a href="#ch07_fig_009">Figure 7.9</a>).</p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch07_fig_009"><figcaption><p class="figure"><span class="label" epub:type="label">Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">7.9</span> The DIKW pyramid</p>
</figcaption><p class="figure-media"><img alt="The DIKW pyramid, from the bottom to top, shows data, information, knowledge and wisdom." src="images/M07NF009.jpg" title="Figure 7.9 The DIKW pyramid"/></p><p class="figure-credits" epub:type="credits" role="doc-credits">SOURCE Created by Longlivetheux and available under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=37705247"><span class="url-hyperlink">https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=37705247</span></a></p></figure><p class="text-fo">At the bottom of the pyramid, raw data are like the raw material – they have little or no value until we do something with them. Jennifer Rowley of Bangor Business School, in her 2007 study of DIKW definitions given in a wide range of textbooks, has characterized data as being: ‘discrete, objective facts or observations, which are unorganized and unprocessed and therefore have no meaning or value because of lack of context and interpretation.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en47" id="ch07_enx47">47</a></span></p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-238" role="doc-pagebreak" title="238"/>Still, it remains critical here to be collecting the right kind of data and gathering them in a way that ensures that they are usable. Innovations are, of course, far more useful to those who have copious amounts of raw material to work from. Thomas Newcomen, one of the pioneers of the Industrial Revolution, invented the first steam engine in 1712. He lived in the South West of England working as an ironmonger, and some of his biggest customers were the early tin mines that proliferated across the region. These tin mines had a significant problem with flooding as the mines became progressively deeper and the traditional methods of removing the water using manual pumping or horses were slow and expensive.</p>
<p class="text">Newcomen’s new steam engine pumped water using a vacuum and was far more efficient at dealing with flooding in mines, enabling them to reach greater depths than had been previously possible. Yet the steam engine was powered by coal and so was rather more useful to those who had a lot of coal to hand. It was good, but not beneficial enough to warrant buying lots of coal and transporting it to the South West. So rather than the first steam engine being built in a Devon tin mine, it was actually installed at a coal mine at Dudley Castle in Staffordshire.</p>
<p class="text">So it is with data. We need to ensure that we have sufficient quantities of usable, relevant, quality data in order to derive true value. We therefore need to ask whether we are asking the right questions, acquiring data that might be useful in driving business outcomes, and ensuring compliance with necessary regulation.</p>
<p class="text">The first key step in generating value from that data is to organize and structure the data and make them accessible in ways that make sense. Structured data is information, and information is more useful than raw data in its ability to answer basic who, what, where, when questions. This relates to the need to structure systems in ways that mean they can interact with others and share data, and to architect data in ways that can enable us to join them up, interrogate or segment. A ‘single customer view’, for example, or the ability to attribute behaviour and interaction back to one customer, is foundational to enabling true omnichannel customer experience, which puts the customer at the centre and supports joined-up, seamless journeys and interaction.</p>
<p class="text">After that, we then need to apply meaning to that structured data – to identify patterns, draw conclusions, understand relationships and connections. This enables us to create knowledge, which can answer the how and why questions. Knowledge is more valuable than information since it gives <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-239" role="doc-pagebreak" title="239"/>us understanding beyond simple questions and enables us to look for patterns that can inform responses.</p>
<p class="text">At the top of the pyramid, wisdom comes from the smart application of knowledge, relating to our ability to establish processes and feedback loops that can put insight into action, learn over time and improve, and derive advantage through experience, efficiency, and effectiveness, for example through algorithmic personalization, machine learning and automation.</p>
<p class="text">A good data strategy and implementation joins up these levels in seamless ways that can enable real and continuous improvement as well as creative leaps forward. Much of this value will come from the application of machine-driven forms of architecting, optimizing and learning, but at every stage there is human intervention necessary to capitalize on the value that comes from the application of data science, interpretation, creativity and intuition. There is huge benefit in the wider application of data-driven decision-making, for example in enabling responsiveness through real-time data dashboards, but there is also significant advantage that can come from the ability to interpret patterns, to predict, envisage and imagine future scenarios and possibilities and be able to realize them through strategy and action.</p>
<p class="text">Data-driven decision-making is more automatic, mechanical, rules based and more governed by evidence and causality. We identify what the data are telling us and we know what to do in response. Data-informed is more about the human ability to interpret identified patterns in the data and use intuition or creativity to imagine and create different possibilities, outcomes or goals. Human ingenuity, creative intelligence, empathy, originality and resourcefulness might all be used to be data-informed.</p>
<p class="text">But we need both. The businesses that will succeed in the data-rich world in which we live now will be those that combine human and machine capability in the most adept ways.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_019">On being data-informed</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Data-driven decision-making suggests more mechanical processes to optimize, improve and execute, and so is more likely to be governed by rules, precedents and guidelines. The much greater level of human intervention involved with data-informed decision-making on the other hand, means that we need to be aware of both the brilliance that humans can bring to solving problems, and the potential flaws and vulnerabilities that this can open us up to.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-240" role="doc-pagebreak" title="240"/>It’s all too easy, for example, for human interpretation to be subject to bias and misdirection and to ignore the importance of intuition and sense making. When the Brodie helmet, designed by John Leopold Brodie in 1915, was introduced to the British army in the First World War it was intended to protect the soldiers from flying shrapnel. Until 1915 soldiers went into battle wearing cloth, felt or leather headgear but it soon became apparent from the huge number of fatal head wounds from modern artillery weapons that something more was needed. After the French army first introduced tin helmets, the British army swiftly followed suit.</p>
<p class="text">Following the introduction of tin helmets, however, when the War Office personnel recorded the number of head injuries per battalion, they were astounded to discover that instead of the total number declining, it had actually gone up by a significant percentage. The intensity of the fighting was no different so they might easily have concluded that tin helmets were no better or were actually worse than cloth caps in protecting the soldiers. But fortunately they realized that what was actually happening was that fewer soldiers were dying on the spot of their head injuries and that more of them were surviving. In other words, the number of recorded head injuries increased but the number of deaths decreased as the helmets did a better job at protecting the troops. It was more likely after helmets were introduced that fragments of shrapnel would cause injury rather than death.</p>
<p class="text">The Brodie helmet represented a masterpiece of simple design and became the inspiration and forerunner of many more modern, technologically advanced combat helmets. By the end of the war, some 7.5 million Brodie helmets had been produced. And yet it might so easily have been dismissed and thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands, of soldiers might never have survived. Rapid conclusion and action from data without thought and intuition can easily lead to misinterpretation and poor outcomes.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_020">Using data to challenge and to pivot</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Smart, agile businesses use evidence-based decision-making combined with human creativity and intuition to create exceptional advantage. But sometimes even data-supported arguments can struggle to overcome entrenched views or approaches.</p>
<p class="text">Freeman Dyson, a renowned British-born theoretical physicist, worked in the Operational Research Section (ORS) of the British Royal Air Force’s Bomber Command during the Second World War. The original ORS, a <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-241" role="doc-pagebreak" title="241"/>mixture of civil servants and academics, was established to advise the Royal Navy on such critical challenges as verifying the destruction of German U-boats and was led by the highly respected experimental physicist Patrick Blackett who had been a naval officer in the First World War. Blackett’s academic standing and naval experience meant that his advice was respected by the admirals and the ORS was extremely effective in its contribution to winning the war against the U-boats in the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="text">Bomber Command was led by the extremely forthright Sir Arthur ‘Bomber’ Harris. The leader of the ORS attached to Bomber Command was Basil Dickins, a career civil servant, whose influence was less direct meaning that the ORS struggled to really challenge the tactics and strategies being championed by Sir Arthur. There were significant challenges in statistically identifying the reasons why so many British bombers were being lost over Germany during the war. Focus was put on how the planes could fly on missions in order to avoid anti-aircraft fire, interceptions from German night fighters, and collisions with other bombers on the raid. The German night-fighter force was tiny in comparison with Bomber Command and was hardly ever shot down by the guns on the bombers, but unknown to the British they had developed a firing system called Schräge Musik (‘crooked music’) which enabled them to fly unseen underneath the bombers and fire upwards against a bomber clearly silhouetted against the night sky. It is estimated that this system efficiently shot down thousands of bombers, but it was only discovered too late for Bomber Command to find anything to counter it.</p>
<p class="text">Perhaps many more bombers would have been saved, however, if Freeman Dyson’s ideas at Bomber Command ORS had not fallen on deaf ears. The planes and their gunners rarely saw the fighters that shot them down. Dyson had suggested that a clear way to reduce the catastrophic losses that Bomber Command was suffering in the Battle of Berlin was to remove two gun turrets from the RAF Lancaster bombers. This would leave them unable to fire on the enemy but would also mean that the planes would be much lighter, faster and more manoeuvrable. Dyson’s work had shown that this would not only make it easier for the Lancasters to evade German fighters, but it would also mean that they were in reach of the fighters for a much shorter amount of time and that each plane could carry five airmen instead of seven. Losses might therefore have been significantly reduced.</p>
<p class="text">Yet as Dyson recounts, the RAF commanders did not like the idea of removing firepower, and his advice ran against prevailing beliefs: ‘our <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-242" role="doc-pagebreak" title="242"/>proposal to rip out the turrets went against the official mythology of the gallant gunners defending their crewmates. Dickins never had the courage to push the issue seriously in his conversations with Harris. If he had, Harris might even have listened, and thousands of crewmen might have been saved.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en48" id="ch07_enx48">48</a></span></p>
<p class="text">This story demonstrates how challenging it can be, even with the support of statistical evidence, to challenge mythologies, beliefs and convictions that can become widely embedded in businesses. If the prevailing stories and traditions that have grown up with the business are challenged by new evidence, it can be very difficult to change course. In order to be genuinely adaptive and build real momentum for change we have to be more willing to hold strong views lightly. To believe with conviction but be willing to change that belief when data tell us that another course of action is necessary.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_021">Navigating with data</h3>
<p class="text-fo">If we are to navigate well with data-driven and data-informed decision-making we need to recognize the potential but also the limitations of both. Key to this is the need to balance optimization and iteration with vision.</p>
<p class="text">Silicon Valley venture capitalist and startup advisor Andrew Chen has described how metrics are typically reflective of a current strategy, position or audience since they are based on existing or past circumstances.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en49" id="ch07_enx49">49</a></span> For this reason, they may help you to iterate towards what he calls the ‘local maximum’ – the point at which you may reach the limit of the current design, structure or customer foundation. It’s as good as it can get given the existing foundation.</p>
<p class="text">In mathematics, functions can have local maximums which are high points that can be reached within a given range or context, but they can also have global maximums which are the highest points that you can reach over the entire domain or function (<a href="#ch07_fig_010">Figure 7.10</a>).</p>
<figure aria-describedby="ch07_fig_010_details" class="figure" id="ch07_fig_010"><figcaption><p class="figure"><span class="label" epub:type="label"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-243" role="doc-pagebreak" title="243"/>Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">7.10</span> Local and global maximums</p></figcaption><p class="figure-media"><img alt="A X-Y graph plots the local maximum curve with a lower peak value than the global maximum." src="images/M07NF010.jpg" title="Figure 7.10 Local and global maximums"/></p>
<details id="ch07_fig_010_details">
<summary>Details</summary>
<p class="figure-alt-long">The local maximum starts near origin, rises to a peak, drops down and immediately rises up to a higher peak of global maximum value. The curve then drops down to almost zero.</p>
</details>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">Evidence-based decision-making is still hugely under-utilized in most businesses, but there is a limit to the gains that we can derive from optimization and it can be tempting to take this too far, de-prioritizing the bigger picture, the broader aspects of a problem or the potential bigger solution. Data are often systematically biased and require intelligent human intervention to design and interpret systems that not only optimize around existing scenarios but open up new possibilities. The kind of data, for example, that are easiest to collect and interrogate are often not the kind that will show us what’s truly possible or where our end-vision could be.</p>
<p class="text">So whilst data-driven decision-making may help us to navigate to local maximums, it is data-informed decision-making that can help us to set a visionary new course towards a new global maximum. In setting that new course, it is likely that we won’t have all the data that we might need right now to complete the journey (since it is, after all, new), so we need to break down the work into smaller pieces and use data to help validate hypotheses and navigate towards the realization of that new end-goal.</p>
<p class="text">Not everything is an optimization problem and whilst there is exceptional value to be had in continual incremental improvement, now and then we need to take a leap forwards in our thinking and set a bigger goal or new course, and entirely new parameters for success.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_022">Learning effectively from data</h3>
<p class="text-fo">As we’ve discussed earlier in the book, scaled learning is key to agile transformation. When we take continuous organizational learning to a new level, it is critical that we do this in ways that avoid poor use of data, poor decision-making and the potential limitations or pitfalls in human intervention.</p>
<p class="text">Let’s take target setting as an example. Goodhart’s Law, named after Charles Goodhart, a chief economic advisor to the Bank of England, states that: ‘When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure’. It is the principle that once we have set a specific target people will have a tendency to optimize behaviour to that single goal, regardless of whether that is at the expense of other important objectives. Oversimplified target <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-244" role="doc-pagebreak" title="244"/>setting can encourage behaviour that might superficially deliver one goal, but not the overarching objective.</p>
<p class="text">Famous examples of Goodhart’s Law are the Soviet factories that, when given targets around numbers of nails, manufactured many hundreds of thousands of tiny, useless nails and, when given targets on the basis of weight, produced a few, very large nails. Or the French colonialists in 1902 Hanoi who, when faced with a potential outbreak of bubonic plague, offered payments to anyone who handed in rats’ tails. Only to find that whilst the total rat population failed to decline, the numbers of tailless rats in the city ballooned.</p>
<p class="text">Goodhart’s Law can mean that in setting targets for complex scenarios we can easily lose sight of any information that qualifies something as a valid measure in the first place, and can result in a misalignment of behaviour through incentives. This means that we are often in danger of pursuing short-term impacts with digital metrics since they can be easier to measure.</p>
<p class="text">Instead, an approach that balances both short-term measures with longer-term impact gives a more rounded view of performance and direction. As Richard Shotton (author of <span class="emphasis">The Choice Factory: 25</span> <span class="emphasis">behavioural</span> <span class="emphasis">biases that influence what we buy</span>) has observed, tracking data is reductive in that it takes a complex, messy reality and converts it into easily manageable numbers but at a potential cost: ‘This process involves a trade-off: a loss of representativeness in return for simplicity... Problems arise when the trade-off is forgotten and tracking data is treated with reverence, as if it was the definitive answer rather than mere evidence.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en50" id="ch07_enx50">50</a></span></p>
<p class="text">When we’re tracking individual metrics it’s all too easy to get caught up in incremental optimization of those metrics and lose sight of the bigger picture. The fetishization of data can mean that we undervalue the benefit that can come from getting out and speaking to real customers. Richard Shotton references the experience of Terry Leahy who, whilst leading marketing at Tesco, was analysing the performance of their gluten-free range of products. The sales data indicated that people who bought these products were not spending much on them each shopping trip and appeared to show that the products were underperforming. Yet rather than just de-list them right away, Leahy interviewed gluten-free shoppers and discovered that their desire to shop in places that had good availability of these products was a determining factor in their choice of supermarket. So rather than stop selling gluten-free products he went the other way and introduced Tesco’s ‘Free From’ range long before the competition and it became highly successful.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-245" role="doc-pagebreak" title="245"/>In a similar fashion, it is important that we balance our use of more traditional market research, which is often based on claimed behaviour, with our use of analytics and customer data, which may well be based on real behaviour. The former can be subject to misrepresentation and misinterpretation. A large study by data-driven online dating site OKCupid in 2010, for example, found that people on the site almost universally added a couple of inches to their actual height on their OKCupid profiles.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en51" id="ch07_enx51">51</a></span> People also exaggerated their salaries, resulting in there being almost four times the number of people who said that they were making US $100,000 a year than there should be. Not only that, but when analysing the technical details of profile photos uploaded to the site they found that, whilst most of the pictures were of recent vintage (with a median age of just 92 days), older people tended to upload older photos of themselves.</p>
<p class="text">Combining claimed behaviour with real behaviour can give us a more three-dimensional view of our customers, for example, by defining personas through not only demographics, age, motivations, needs and frustrations but also real behaviour and interaction. Traditional market research may be great at identifying big picture market or customer changes, views or even opportunity but real behaviour offers different value in some crucial respects. When it comes to prototyping, fast customer feedback loops and iterative development, for example, real behaviour trumps claimed behaviour every time.</p>
<p class="text">One of the vulnerabilities around the human interventions involved with learning from data and data-informed decision-making are the cognitive biases that we are all subject to. Earlier in this section we discussed (with the story of the Bomber Command ORS in the Second World War) how hard it can be to overturn powerfully held opinions, even with data that support a different point of view. Confirmation bias, or the tendency that we have to look for information that confirms our pre-existing beliefs or hypotheses, can be a powerful blocker to change, organizational learning and adaptability. Economist John Kay (also the author of <span class="emphasis">Obliquity: Why</span> <span class="emphasis">our goals are best achieved ind</span><span class="emphasis">irectly</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en52" id="ch07_enx52">52</a></span>) has written about how in his early career he believed that his work constructing economic arguments and building models for corporate clients was about helping them to make better decisions when in reality it was often about justifying conclusions that had already been arrived at. This he describes as ‘Franklin’s Gambit’ in reference to Benjamin Franklin’s approach to decision-making, which is: ‘the process of finding a weighty and carefully analysed rationale for a decision that has already been made’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en53" id="ch07_enx53">53</a></span></p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-246" role="doc-pagebreak" title="246"/>Whilst there is often an appearance of setting-out objectives, and a process for proper evaluation of evidence and options, the objectives might well be dictated by the conclusions, the options presented in ways that make the preferred course of action look most beneficial, and the data selected to demonstrate the desired result.</p>
<p class="text">Confirmation bias can be particularly powerful when it comes to negative views of change, where people are against a certain course of action and actively look for things that might justify their position or thinking. The best course of action in this context is to build wider support for the course of action using both evidence and the visible support of key people surrounding the detractors. People have a tendency to overrate their own capabilities and intelligence and so find reasons not to believe contradictory opinions. So enabling detractors to undertake their own journey and find their own reasons why the preferred course of action is a good one helps to support real, lasting change.</p>
<p class="text">One of the most important biases to be aware of, particularly when it comes to agile transformation, is survivorship bias – the tendency we all have to prefer to learn from successful instances and examples rather than those that have failed. One of my favourite stories about this phenomenon is another more widely known story from the Second World War involving bomber planes. Abraham Wald, a renowned mathematician and statistician, was asked by the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1943 to be part of a group that was looking at how the US bombers that were flying daytime raids over Germany might be reinforced to prevent the heavy losses that they were suffering at the time. The USAF was proposing to put armour plating on the planes, but could do this only to a limited degree or the bombers would be too heavy to fly. The research that the military had conducted into damage that planes returning from missions had suffered revealed that bullet holes on the bomber planes often clustered notably around the wings, the centre of the fuselage and around the tail gunner (<a href="#ch07_fig_011">Figure 7.11</a>). As a result the USAF proposed to reinforce these exact areas where the most damage could be seen.</p>

<p class="figure-alt-long">The tail appears connected to the mid of the plane on both sides. Multiple red dots are all over the center and tail end of the plane.</p>

<p class="text-fo">Wald, however, recognized that this was a big mistake and told the USAF that it should in fact do the opposite. He knew that the bullet hole clusters were actually showing where a plane could be hit and still make it back to base. The reinforcment actually needed to be placed in the areas where the surviving planes looked relatively unscathed, since the planes that were hit in these areas never returned. Wald’s resultant calculations about the vulnerability of particular parts of planes no doubt saved many lives and are still used today.</p>
<p class="text">Survivorship bias in business typically shows itself in a greater willingness and enthusiasm to learn from successful initiatives or examples in and outside of the company, and in the undervaluing of the learning we can gain from what has been unsuccessful. This can not only lead to false conclusions but can also reinforce behaviours that avoid risk and potential failure. A great culture of learning in the organization needs to support and encourage learning from both successes and failures.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_023">Agile governance</h3>
<p class="text-fo">During the shift to more adaptive, agile ways of working, and particularly as agile scales beyond the technology team towards a much broader application across multiple functions, questions often arise around governance and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-248" role="doc-pagebreak" title="248"/>control. Concerns can be raised about alignment, control of costs and direction. People often feel uncomfortable moving away from the apparent comfort of a detailed, forecasted end-point, and leaders shy away from the apparent inherent risks.</p>
<p class="text">The irony of this situation, of course, is that many traditional approaches are built on false certainty anyway. Plans and forecasts become outdated as soon as they’re inked. Predicted outcomes quickly become obsolete and in need of updating. Managers spend their time justifying why they’ve moved away from forecast numbers rather than getting on and doing the work.</p>
<p class="text">Yet <span class="emphasis">doing</span> agile does not mean that there is poor quality control involved in the work. <span class="emphasis">Being</span> agile is not an excuse for sloppiness. If by governance we essentially mean doing the right things in the right way, then agile, iterative working should actually enable this more than rigid linear thinking and working since it allows you to bring more flexibility to how you can change direction and not go too far down a path that is wasteful or even potentially damaging. Agile governance done right means mitigating risk rather than compounding it. The ability to be more adaptive means that we never get too far before we can switch course; the practice of working closely with end-user input and feedback; continuous testing and delivery.</p>
<p class="text">Jamie Arnold, the Head of Agile Delivery at UK retailing and banking group the Co-op, has highlighted eight key components for how to do governance well in an agile context, which are worth paraphrasing and highlighting in this context:<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en54" id="ch07_enx54">54</a></span></p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Outcomes are better than deliverables:</span> the importance of orienting the team around what the product or service actually does, aligning that with the wider vision, easily measurable mid- or long-term goals, space to learn what works rather than specifying the solution upfront.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Measure the right things at the right time:</span> measure a few quantitative things, make the measures visible, independently verifiable, review often. The right measures can motivate, focus and build confidence.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Teams are the units of delivery:</span> small, multidisciplinary, non-hierarchical teams focused on momentum and given enough autonomy to plan, prioritize and do the work in the order that works for them.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Network of teams beats hierarchy:</span> networks of small, self-directed teams with minimal interdependencies using data to plan and prioritize.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Quality is everyone’s responsibility:</span> common agreement around what quality means, how to measure it, user feedback validating the delivery of business value, continuous quality assurance.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-249" role="doc-pagebreak" title="249"/>Assure as you go:</span> improvement is continuous and supported by regular, short, challenging forums, minimal stop–start but instead the flow of value delivery.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Behaviours matter more than documents:</span> less long-term documentation, more user research logs, weeknotes, verified metrics. Focus on how the team collaborates, responds to feedback, is part of a network of teams, involves stakeholders, removes blockers.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">See delivery for yourself:</span> not just talk, but regularly showing work in progress.</p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo">These principles for how to do agile governance well have application beyond just the teams in a business that might be using Agile methodologies. They speak to wider opportunity to follow principles that can ensure a balance that allows for greater adaptation whilst not sacrificing the need for proper quality control, testing and governance.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_024">Supporting self-awareness and trust</h3>
<p class="text-fo">It is important that we close this penultimate section by acknowledging again the importance of leadership in supporting agile transformation. Great leadership has always been about great communication, exceptional collaboration skills, and the ability to get the very best out of people and teams, but this has never been more important in this highly changeable age.</p>
<p class="text">It is very difficult to work in effective, fast, cross-disciplinary ways if there are not high levels of trust in the business. Leaders who can create an environment that not only enables people to do their best work, but one that enables people to do their best work as part of a highly functioning team, can add disproportionate value. This requires high levels of self-awareness.</p>
<p class="text">The Johari window<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en55" id="ch07_enx55">55</a></span> is a useful heuristic technique that can help leaders of all kinds to understand how they might improve group dynamics, intergroup relationships and team development but also their own communication, self-awareness and working relationships. Developed by psychologists Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham in 1955, the window is one of the few tools that focuses on so-called ‘soft skills’, and it supports better self-awareness of how well we know ourselves, how others perceive us, how we interact with others and how we present ourselves.</p>
<p class="text">The framework is simple but powerful and is based on considering what we know about ourselves and what we don’t, and what others might know about us and what they don’t.</p>
<p class="text">In <a href="#ch07_fig_012">Figure 7.12</a>, the four panes of the window look equal, but the idea is that the ‘openness’ of each panel depends on how well we know ourselves, how much we share about ourselves with others, and how well others know us:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Open self or arena</span> (top left): information about you that both you and others know.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Blind self</span> (top right): information about yourself that you don’t know but others do.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Hidden self or façade</span> (bottom left): information about yourself that you know but others don’t.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Unknown self</span> (bottom right): information about you that neither you nor others know.</p></li>
</ul><figure aria-describedby="ch07_fig_012_details" class="figure" id="ch07_fig_012"><figcaption><p class="figure"><span class="label" epub:type="label"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-250" role="doc-pagebreak" title="250"/>Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">7.12</span> The Johari window</p>
</figcaption><p class="figure-media"><img alt="A matrix shows the Johari window with horizontal values as ‘known to self’ and ‘not known to self’. The vertical values are ‘known to others’ and ‘not known to others’.

<details id="ch07_fig_012_details">
<summary>Details</summary>
<p class="figure-alt-long">The attributes for the four combinations are:</p><ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Known to others- known to self: Arena</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Known to others- not known to self: Blind spot</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Not known to others- known to self: Façade</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Not known to others- not known to self: Unknown</p></li></ul>
</details>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">One way of using the Johari window is to have subjects choose from a predefined list of adjectives (which may be possible descriptions of the participant) a selection of those which they feel best describe their personality, and then have their peers do the same with an equal number of adjectives.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en56" id="ch07_enx56">56</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Positioning the adjectives into the two-by-two grid enables subjects to focus on how they might work towards opening their personal open windowpanes and closing their blind or hidden ones. Someone who has <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-251" role="doc-pagebreak" title="251"/>high self-awareness and high trust will have windows that are bigger on the left-hand side. Someone who has low self-awareness and low trust will have windows that are bigger on the right-hand side. As we become more intentional with our self-awareness and as we trust other team members more, the more we expand the open windows. Doing this for each team member enables better communication, improved trust and transparency, openness and honesty, and so increases productive and effective working. These kinds of attributes may seem nice to have but are increasingly critical in enabling teams to move fast and collaborate horizontally in ways that can create disproportionate advantage and performance.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch07_h3_025">Leading teams through change and uncertainty</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Change is always emotive. So leading teams effectively through transformation helps us to appreciate the emotions that might be involved with significant change. The Kübler-Ross Grief Cycle is a relatively well-known way of thinking about the more emotive responses to high levels of change and unpredictability.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch07_en57" id="ch07_enx57">57</a></span> Although the model was originated in the context of responses to grief, it is useful in supporting an appreciation of the emotional aspects of broader, significant change. The model features five key stages:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">Our initial response may well be founded in shock and even denial that the change is even happening. The leadership response to this should be founded in clear messaging and signals about the reality of the need to change.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">We then may react with anger and frustration, which calls for understanding but also communication and information.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">We may then attempt to find meaning in the change and reach out to others but still struggle initially to understand it fully. Emotional support is key.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Some may feel overwhelmed by change, and even slightly lost, in which case coaching and guidance will help.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">The importance of storytelling, shared experiences, guidance and direction to help people to find their own meaning in the change and eventually to accept and move on.</p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo">It is a great way of thinking about the stages of change but, of course, the reality of the transformation that many organizations are undergoing is less <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-252" role="doc-pagebreak" title="252"/>of transition from A to B and more of a journey to become a business that in itself is characterized by continuous change. So the point that many miss is that leaders trying to navigate this process will likely find that they need to deal with these reactions from many different sources and all at once.</p>
<p class="text">The real skill in leading through times of high uncertainty is being highly tuned to the emotive context of our surroundings: to have empathy. Sure, we need clear direction, continuous communication, shared learning, accountability, openness and transparency, and a bias towards action, but we also need the emotional intelligence to understand the support that people really need to come on the journey with us.</p>
