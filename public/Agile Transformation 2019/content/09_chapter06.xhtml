<h2 class="head-a" id="ch06_h2_001"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_045">Why start small?</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">As we’ve already discussed, small, empowered teams can not only move faster, but can also generate disproportionate impact and change. Agile principles applied judiciously at scale in an organization can create heightened levels of responsiveness for the whole company. A company that learns fast is a company that is building resilience in a complex adaptive world. So, we shouldn’t be linear and waterfall about how we become more adaptive as an organization. In other words, we need to be agile about how we become more agile.</p>
<p class="text">There is no single blueprint for success. No set roadmap to follow. But there is an approach that can enable every business to find its own unique way to success.</p>
<p class="text">Starting small allows a company to mitigate risk, not bet the entire company but instead to learn fast what will work for its unique contexts. Starting small enables a company to find its own way, stay close to changing contexts whilst driving change. Starting small enables business ambidexterity – the capability to manage business as usual whilst also creating the business of the future, to change the wheels on the car as it is driving along.</p>
<p class="text">Starting small ensures that a business can get past being ‘stuck’.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch06_h3_001">The key elements of starting small</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Starting small is about piloting new approaches that can catalyse learning and enable a more informed approach to rapid scaling:</p>
<ul class="list"><li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Focus:</span> selecting the right projects, initiatives, areas or objectives on which to pilot new ways of working.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-176" role="doc-pagebreak" title="176"/>Setting the teams up for success:</span> getting the right people, creating the optimal chance that the teams will thrive, and mitigating the inevitable tensions that will arise between old and new.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Mindset:</span> acknowledging some of the key mindset shifts involved with start small, and why they can be so difficult to embed.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch06_h2_002"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_046">Achieving ambidexterity</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Running a large business today means delivering to shareholder value whilst simultaneously inventing the business of the future. So the business of today and tomorrow needs to be structured in a way that creates a steady stream of new value as easily as possible. It needs to be well-managed enough to ensure exceptional efficiency and continuous optimization of known components, whilst also having the desire, discipline and space to experiment and find profit in new paradigms.</p>
<p class="text">Hierarchy enables governance, vertically focused productivity, optimization and efficiency. Networked small teams enable experimentation, rapid development of value, adaptability and exploration. We need both but we need a balance between the two. That balance is likely to shift over time, so we need to be flexible in how we resource both sides. The inherent risk is that we create separation between the two sides and so we need to ensure there are strong links between them but also the right kind of links that do not hamper agility. And every organization and its contexts are different.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch06_h3_002">Starting small to scale fast</h3>
<p class="text-fo">The key to achieving the right balance is to think big, start small and scale fast. We need to have the vision for the change that we want to make and the senior commitment to establish infrastructure and culture enablers, but then we can start small with a few small, multidisciplinary teams or squads aligned to key challenges or opportunities and then scale the number of teams rapidly as new opportunities emerge. I may be using the term ‘dual operating system’ here but in reality, small squads may be aligned to a variety of different objectives that may be focused on exploration, execution or even extension and exploitation. Typical alignment for teams might include:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Strategic challenges:</span> high-level or more specific challenges that the business is facing. A small agile team or squad can explore the territory to better define the challenge, understand its components or influences, and even start to develop solutions.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-177" role="doc-pagebreak" title="177"/>Innovation and new opportunity:</span> any new proposition can be developed and tested rapidly in order to generate new value, emergent areas and markets can be explored.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Service design and transformation:</span> small squads can be aligned to redesigning or improving specific services.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Customer journey:</span> teams might be aligned to end-to-end customer journeys or improving specific areas of customer engagement.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Process, network or relationship optimization:</span> the improvement of processes, driving efficiencies, working smarter with suppliers and partners, optimizing ecosystems.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Technology development and implementation:</span> the building and integration of new technologies and systems.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">Teams that are aligned to innovation, generating new value, understanding and defining strategic challenges operate in the explore domain. Squads that are working on commercializing and scaling innovations or looking to create opportunity through adjacencies operate in the execute domain. Teams that are focused on optimization, reapplying existing capabilities in new ways, creating reusable components from them, driving efficiencies, protecting advantage, operate in the extend and exploit domain.</p>
<p class="text">An example start small to scale fast may be the organization that begins by defining several key business challenges that it needs to solve and aligns a squad to explore each challenge. Those teams work iteratively to turn those high-level business challenges into more defined challenges or even into customer problems to solve. A larger number of teams then work iteratively to solve those problems, which in turn generates further opportunity.</p>
<p class="text">In order to succeed, teams need a definitive objective that can be captured in one sentence. This is the reason that the team exists and its north star. Where possible this should reflect customer and business need. It should be up on the wall where the team is co-located. The team needs the combination of skills in the team that can achieve the outputs required, and no more. Once the objective is set, a small basket of measures may be specified upfront that will provide a way of monitoring progress and delivery of value. The team needs logical but wide guard rails that define its domain of authority – enough autonomy to be able to move fast and make whatever changes that it needs to make to optimize outcomes against its objective, but not so loose that a critical business system may be taken offline by its activity. An example of this is giving a squad end-to-end responsibility for a customer journey. Doing this generates real opportunity to create exceptional customer experience since the team has the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-178" role="doc-pagebreak" title="178"/>ability to work on whichever part of the customer journey needs fixing, to prioritize well, and create a truly seamless journey. Having one or more parts of a customer journey not within its domain or authority could result in a disjointed or poor experience.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch06_h3_003">Separation and integration</h3>
<p class="text-fo">There are a number of key ways in which the dual operating system can take shape, but the key watch-out is the integration challenges that can get in the way of scalability or hamper the adoption of new ways of working. We might consider there to be three key approaches to catalyse agile adoption:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Independent units:</span> with this approach, a new unit is established that has a good degree of separation from the main hierarchical organization. The unit might be a startup within the mother organization but could well be housed in a different building or location. The separation creates the space for new ways of working to embed more easily and it also allows organizations to build propositions that can exist in the market on their own merits. The clear downside to this approach is that whilst it may be an excellent way to launch new digital-native brands, there is limited learning that comes back into the organization and the disconnection limits the transformational impact at the core. There is a danger that change becomes compartmentalized and the wider organization does not feel that it is relevant to them.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Pirate within:</span> a new team, market or brand is positioned as a catalyst for change and given the freedom to adopt new operating models and processes. There is still a degree of separation between the traditional and new ways of working but the new team will likely not be in a separate building and may well use many of the essential capabilities of the wider organization whilst having greater flexibility to look outside. The advantage here is that learning is more easily scaled more widely across the business and there is an obvious exemplar for change. The potential challenge is that there is not enough space between the old and the new and so the latter becomes stifled, or that there is too much space, which makes it difficult to scale. An innovation lab, for example, may originate great concepts but on its own will not save your company – for that you need execution and scaling.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Integrated:</span> in a more integrated approach, small teams may be aligned to different areas, markets and different objectives as a catalyst for change. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-179" role="doc-pagebreak" title="179"/>They are not aligned to a specific function, brand or proposition area within the business but seek to drive change by demonstrating in close proximity how things can be done differently. The advantage comes from that proximity, and the ability to rapidly scale, drive change from within and socialize new approaches easily. The challenge also comes from that proximity, and the danger of the new being misunderstood, or suffocated, or tissue rejection kicking in.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">Different approaches suit different contexts, and might involve different strategies including acquisition, working with external partners in new ways, startup incubators and accelerators.</p>
<p class="text">The key point is that leaders need to always be aware of the challenges and opportunities created by proximity and work to mitigate those risks and capitalize on the benefits. There will always need to be enough space and support to allow new ways of working to flourish, but in order to catalyse transformation in a larger organization there also needs to be enough integration to enable scalability.</p>

<header><h1 class="title" epub:type="title" id="ch06_h1_002">CASE STUDY <span class="emphasis">Vodafone’s transformation</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="text-fo">Vodafone has undergone a significant long-term transformation that has put culture, people and technology at the heart of a comprehensive agile change programme. Historically a largely decentralized business, the company took some decisions at the beginning of a decade-long process to centralize some key facets of its technology capability that would enable change and provide a common infrastructure platform. The company also underwent a programme to capitalize on the huge opportunity for unified communication and shared learning, upgrading communications technology and the approaches around it to embed new behaviours in everyday working. It also invested in systems to enable automated testing and continuous deployment, which enabled digital releases to be reduced from a frequency of six-months to one week and then daily. Digital skills were brought in-house changing the business from being 97 per cent outsourced to one which was 95 per cent in-house, enabling greater control, lowering costs and improving time to market.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en1" id="ch06_enx1">1</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Yet alongside this technology transformation there was a powerful focus on how the company could bring its people on the journey with it. A new vision around what it really meant to be a ‘digital telco’ ran through the business as a way of capturing a step change in expectation around both customer and employee experience and aligning the external brand with the internal employee value proposition. This vision <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-180" role="doc-pagebreak" title="180"/>was expressed in an approach to digital-native working that Vodafone framed as ‘The Digital Vodafone Way’, which acted as a signal to the business of the importance of new ways of working but which created common approaches whilst allowing enough flexibility for successful localization.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en2" id="ch06_enx2">2</a></span></p>
<p class="text">A key part in this shift was the widespread adoption of agile thinking and principles right through the business. The board spent time in Silicon Valley being immersed in digital-native approaches and ways of working, and thousands of senior leaders went through an immersive programme that reset expectation but also supported much broader understanding of agile culture and principles. A series of hackathons, town halls and communications helped socialize this understanding. The introduction of the ‘Digital Ninjas’ for the top 250 leaders connected young digitally savvy employees to key directors.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en3" id="ch06_enx3">3</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The business worked to move beyond approaches characterized by discipline silos, large builds and long lead times through giving staff greater autonomy and empowering them to respond faster to changing customer needs. A ‘Build it, Ship it, Love it’ code amongst the engineering teams encouraged a sense of ownership and pride in the work that they were doing. Engineering talent shortages were addressed through university partnerships and apprenticeships, and a programme called ‘Code Ready’ gave frontline retail and contact centre staff the opportunity to retrain as developers in 16 weeks.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en4" id="ch06_enx4">4</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Alongside this culture and behaviour change Vodafone underwent an operating model shift, adopting an approach that scaled agile working rapidly and created a series of small, multidisciplinary squads in each operating market focused on specific objectives. These pilot squads were fully supported with new tools, process support and working environment change. In 12 months, this approach scaled across 16 different countries, 200 squads and 2,000 people, with an ambition to take this much further.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en5" id="ch06_enx5">5</a></span></p>
</section>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch06_h3_004">Selection criteria for early projects</h3>
<p class="text-fo">When beginning a transformation process or starting to shape new ways of working, the selection criteria for early projects can make a real difference in determining early success or failure. New projects or initiatives can be an excellent catalyst for new ways of working within a large organization, as long as this ‘start small’ is then followed expeditiously with a rapid scaling and learning. It’s important to look for quick wins, to buy time, to create early exemplars that help to socialize a new way of working, but it’s also important to scale quickly to things that have significant impact.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-181" role="doc-pagebreak" title="181"/>The team that led the transformation at the UK Government Digital Service have written about how the first challenge for a team that is working on digital transformation is to prove to those watching that the team can deliver something that really works a whole order of magnitude faster, better and of more value than the organization has ever been able to do before: ‘The strategy for your first project, like all that follow, should be delivery.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en6" id="ch06_enx6">6</a></span></p>
<p class="text">That same team identified four key questions that can inform the selection criteria for early projects – questions that enable a balance to be struck between delivering maximum impact and value to users, whilst mitigating political risk that might get in the way (the questions are paraphrased here):</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">How many people will benefit, and how much?</span> A good strategy is small noticeable improvement for a large number of people (they give the example of a search query that millions of people ask every year – when is the next national holiday? – and creating a simple page to answer it).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Is solving this a common problem?</span> Often organizations solve problems many times over in different places, so early projects should focus on creating services that can be reused and repurposed by other teams.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">How institutionally complex is it?</span> Earlier in the book I talked about the challenges brought by architectural and radical innovation that challenges existing organization structures. Having multiple departments involved in a project does more than anything else to hamper agility and quick delivery so it’s important wherever possible to pick projects that have clear institutional boundaries, and which are entirely owned within the organization.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Is it greenfield or brownfield?</span> Greenfield projects are those that are built to meet a user need that is new (or at least newly defined). This is fresh territory, unencumbered with embedded assumptions. Brownfield projects naturally come with layers of expectation, political baggage and potential restrictions in technology or process.</p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo">It can be so important when starting small to give yourself maximum chance of success. They can be the catalyst for new ways of working at a much more scaled level, but early projects will need to disprove the cynics, and demonstrate clearly the benefits that agile teams can bring. So pick your projects with care.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch06_h3_005">Selecting the right teams – missionaries not mercenaries</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Agile teams typically combine a broad triumvirate of three areas of skill/experience/expertise: business, creative and technology. You need people <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-182" role="doc-pagebreak" title="182"/>and roles (like product managers, delivery managers, user researchers) that can link the team’s activity back to commercial impact and the wider needs of both users and the business. You need people who have creative skills (like designers or content designers) or are creative problem-solvers. And you need people who are skilled with technology (like developers) and have high technology literacy.</p>
<p class="text">Beyond skills and aptitude, you need the right attitude. In the early stages of implementing different ways of operating in the business, it’s critical to have people that really <span class="emphasis">believe</span> in the change actually <span class="emphasis">enacting</span> the change. We need missionaries, not mercenaries. Missionaries will continue to push forwards even when they are surrounded by resistance. Mercenaries (people who are there because they’ve been told to be there, or are a part of the project purely for compensation) will always be weighing up whether the effort is actually worth the reward. Missionaries will be passionate enough to sweep people up in their enthusiasm and bring people on the journey with them. Mercenaries will be motivated by self-gain. Missionaries are willing to challenge precedent and convention for reasons that support positive change. Mercenaries challenge rules out of self-interest.</p>
<p class="text">Missionaries lead. Mercenaries manage. Management is a brilliant invention since it enables organizations to scale in orderly, predictable, stable and aligned ways. But management is not leadership. Leadership is about empowering a direction that people want to follow, and enabling the circumstances that enable people to realize that vision. Real leadership doesn’t only reside at the top of an organization. It can exist anywhere that there are passionate people who want to make a difference.</p>
<p class="text">Transforming a legacy business can be a gruelling, bruising experience. You’re forging a new path, asking the challenging questions, doing things differently. So you need resilience. Transformation is as much a personal challenge and journey as it is a corporate one. That’s why you need missionaries. People who can see the change that’s needed and have the passion and enthusiasm to advocate it and bring it to life. People who are willing to go against the flow. We need to empower our missionaries, and celebrate our mavericks.</p>

<header><h1 class="title" epub:type="title" id="ch06_h1_003">CASE STUDY <span class="emphasis">Nasa’s Pirates</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="text-fo">John Muratore, a young engineer fresh out of the US Air Force, joined NASA’s Johnson Space Center in 1983. When he began he was surprised to discover that the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-183" role="doc-pagebreak" title="183"/>shuttle mission control centre still ran on an old, basic mainframe system from the Apollo era. The system lacked the capability to handle more than a limited number of simultaneous calculations and updates to functionality could take months. The system might have worked well for past missions, but with growing complexity to the Space Shuttle missions and NASA’s ambitions for a new International Space Station, it was in danger of being overwhelmed.</p>
<p class="text">Alongside a group of other newly recruited engineers, Muratore made the case that the system needed to be upgraded to one that was more modern, scalable, flexible and open to incorporate new as yet unrealized technologies. Yet their pleas were dismissed by leaders who remained confident in their outdated system. As Muratore has described it: ‘It was a constant battle because the mainframe community wanted to bring all the workstations and the applications there underneath the mainframe complex, and we wanted to have the power and flexibility of distributed computing.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en7" id="ch06_enx7">7</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Undeterred, the group of engineers (who would later become known as the ‘Pirates’ in reference to their renegade approach) set out to show how improved and upgraded technology could benefit mission control. Making use of off-the-shelf and borrowed hardware, code that they wrote themselves, a small budget that they acquired from a new technology fund, and hundreds of hours of time outside of their core responsibilities, they created Real-Time Data Systems (RTDS), an upgraded system that had much improved capabilities, was more robust and enabled flight controllers to make better decisions, faster. When its capabilities became clear, the new system won senior support and it began to replace the outdated mainframe technology, transforming Space Shuttle mission control.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en8" id="ch06_enx8">8</a></span></p>
<p class="text">After this success, Muratore was given the task of upgrading the mission control system for the upcoming International Space Station (ISS). Realizing that they needed to operate differently from established NASA ways of working in order to achieve their objective, Muratore and his team created a ‘Pirate Paradigm’ to switch the risk equation to show that there was greater risk to not changing than there was of just doing the wrong thing: ‘This got me in a lot of trouble eventually, but the idea behind the Pirate Paradigm was to switch the way we looked at the problem from “this is a big facility and it’s our job to protect it” to “if we don’t make radical change, everything’s going to go away”.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en9" id="ch06_enx9">9</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The team realized the need to challenge the existing culture if they were ever to succeed in the task they had been set. So the paradigm celebrated values such as continuous improvement, frequent experimentation, short-milestones, testing and learning, a focus on results and cutting through bureaucracy, emphasizing ownership and accountability but also challenging convention. Their ‘build a little, test a little, fix a little’ approach involved breaking down big problems into smaller elements, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-184" role="doc-pagebreak" title="184"/>creating solutions to those smaller components that users could use immediately, learning and iterating to then add on new pieces, and making the solutions universal enough to come together to solve the bigger problem.</p>
<p class="text">Research from a team of academics from Warwick Business School showed that a key part of the Pirate Paradigm was the ‘Pirate Code’, which reads like an early version of the agile manifesto:<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en10" id="ch06_enx10">10</a></span></p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Don’t wait to be told to do something; figure it out for yourself.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Challenge everything, and steel yourself for the inevitable cynicism, opposition, rumours, false reporting, innuendos and slander.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Break the rules, not the law.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Take risks as a rule, not as the exception.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Cut out unnecessary timelines, schedules, processes, reviews and bureaucracy.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Just get started; fix problems as you go along.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Build a product, not an organization; outsource as much as possible.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">Muratore’s team were a group of mavericks not afraid to challenge the norms and champion new ways of working within a rules-bound, strictly hierarchical organization. It shows the transformational impact that a small team with a big ambition can have. They were able to affect real change, win senior support, and eventually deliver huge cost savings to the programme through improved, enhanced technology.</p>
<p class="text">People who are determined enough to go up against long-standing, entrenched practices and culture in order to drive change in an environment that doesn’t want it are rare but valuable. We need to celebrate these astute renegades, allow them the space to challenge and the consideration to give them the time, space and opportunity to prove the potential of their ideas. In a truly agile business, they can be transformational.</p>
</section>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch06_h3_006">Setting your teams up for success</h3>
<p class="text-fo">When still in the foothills of agile transformation it is critical that the first teams are given as much chance to succeed as possible. Above all this means that wherever possible sponsorship for what the teams are working on comes from the highest level possible in business. It can certainly be possible to begin under the radar with a ‘ask forgiveness, not permission’ approach, but pretty soon more senior buy-in will become essential. The people in the teams need to be as focused as possible on delivery, and that means that this senior sponsorship will be key in providing cover and removing the teams <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-185" role="doc-pagebreak" title="185"/>from the kind of political wrangling that gets in the way of shipping outputs fast. The danger will always be tissue rejection by the large bureaucratic areas of the business. Good gatekeeping will also be needed on an ongoing basis to prevent the teams from getting swamped with low-value, short-term priorities from the business. The product team plays a key role in this, ensuring that the business strategy is mapped to a clear product strategy, and development is more proactive than it is reactive.</p>
<p class="text">Companies like to make big announcements about new initiatives but far better to break cover when the teams have something good to show, and to build credibility and reputation through delivery. As the UK Government Digital Team put it: ‘Good digital work is a million silent nods of approval, not one loud round of applause.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en11" id="ch06_enx11">11</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Once delivery is well in progress the teams should be able to move forwards with focus and speed. Early successes can move swiftly into something integral to what the organization does on a daily basis. Focus should then shift to scaling fast – transforming the small proportion of propositions or services that account for the majority of impact/user interaction/revenue and profit.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch06_h2_003"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_047">Defining a new way of working</a></h2>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch06_h3_007">Why, in order to scale, sometimes you need to do things that don’t scale</h3>
<p class="text-fo">The challenge of starting small is often that the mindset of a large organization is so wrapped up in linear, waterfall approaches that it can be extremely difficult to suggest anything else. Ideas need to have big investment, returns need to be sizeable and realized early, programmes and projects need to work immediately and robustly across large numbers of employees or customers.</p>
<p class="text">But what happens when you need to start small, learn and scale from there? And what happens when you need to do something that doesn’t scale? Airbnb co-founder Brian Chesky tells a story from the earliest days of the service when they were still part of the programme in Y-Combinator, the Silicon Valley seed accelerator. Paul Graham (founder of Y-Combinator) had asked him where they were getting traction with their idea. Brian told him that they didn’t actually have a lot of traction at the time, but they did have a few people in New York who had started using the service:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-186" role="doc-pagebreak" title="186"/>Graham: ‘So your users are in New York and you’re still in Mountain View.’</p>
</blockquote><blockquote><p class="block-quote">Chesky: ‘Yeah.’</p>
</blockquote><blockquote><p class="block-quote">Graham: ‘What are you still doing here?’</p>
</blockquote><blockquote><p class="block-quote">Chesky: ‘What do you mean?’</p>
</blockquote><blockquote><p class="block-quote">Graham: ‘Go to your users. Get to know them. Get your customers one by one.’</p>
</blockquote><blockquote><p class="block-quote">Chesky: ‘But that won’t scale. If we’re huge and we have millions of customers we can’t meet every customer.’</p>
</blockquote><blockquote><p class="block-quote">Graham: ‘That’s exactly why you should do it now because this is the only time you’ll ever be small enough that you can meet all your customers, get to know them, and make something directly for them.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en12" id="ch06_enx12">12</a></span></p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">So the Airbnb founders literally commuted from Mountain View to New York, and went door to door, meeting their hosts in person. To give them a reason for visiting they personally offered to photograph the host places for the site. When they’d talk to the hosts they would get direct feedback that enabled them to start designing touchpoint by touchpoint in order to handcraft the user experience and feed directly into their product roadmap. Brian Chesky describes how this roadmap often exists in the minds of the users that you’re designing for.</p>
<p class="text">Almost all of the early features that would become critical to Airbnb’s success came from that early feedback. As Airbnb grew, that habit of handcrafting the user experience stayed with them as they visualized what a truly exceptional experience might look like in order to challenge thinking, and work back from the customer to deliver a service that is truly remarkable. The core thesis, says Chesky, is that: ‘if you want to build a massively successful company, you need to build something that people love so much they tell each other. Which means that you must build something worth talking about.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en13" id="ch06_enx13">13</a></span></p>
<p class="text">It’s too easy in large organizations to dismiss doing things that don’t scale. Like talking face to face with your earliest users to craft remarkable experiences. It’s too common for leaders, as they progress higher up the hierarchy, to become more and more distant from actual customers. We need to challenge these conventions. And that’s as much about culture and mindset as it is about process and practice.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch06_h3_008">Building high-performing teams</h3>
<p class="text-fo">What truly distinguishes high-performing teams from those that might be otherwise? It’s a question that is worth exploring not only because every <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-187" role="doc-pagebreak" title="187"/>business chases high performance, but also because there is a good potential for misinterpretation and a poor understanding of what truly makes a difference. The point in looking at the research behind this question is that creating an environment that supports high performance is critical to any business that wants to be more agile, and yet incentives and rewards are so often positioned around the wrong things.</p>
<p class="text">Some of the best, and most comprehensive, research into team performance has been done by Google, whose comprehensive multiyear studies, aligned to academic research findings and conducted across hundreds of teams, have shown that many of the factors that we traditionally associate with significantly influencing team performance (team longevity, background, personality or skills of team members) make little difference.</p>
<p class="text">Instead, a study that considered more than 250 attributes of over 180 active Google teams demonstrated that there were five key dynamics that characterized high performance:<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en14" id="ch06_enx14">14</a></span></p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Psychological safety:</span> the ability to say what we really mean, and take risks in the team environment without feeling insecure.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Dependability:</span> being able to rely on other team members to do high-quality work on time.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Structure &amp; clarity:</span> ensuring that goals, execution plans and roles of individual team members are clear.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Meaning of work:</span> the work that is being done is personally important.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Impact of work:</span> the feeling that the work being done actually matters.</p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo">The idea of psychological safety and the group norms on the team (or what Charles Duhigg calls ‘the traditions, behavioural standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en15" id="ch06_enx15">15</a></span>) proved to be far and away the most important factor. Professor Amy Edmondson from Harvard Business School has defined psychological safety as a ‘shared belief held by members of a team that the team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en16" id="ch06_enx16">16</a></span> Psychological safety should enable team members to say what they really mean, feel that they are working in an environment of high trust, healthy debate and respect. Analyst Ben Thompson has described a culture of true collaboration as being one that is able to combine mutual trust and respect and comfort with dissent.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en17" id="ch06_enx17">17</a></span> These are the building blocks for collaboration, and a culture that can move fast.</p>

<p class="text-fo">What most people miss about high-performing teams is that, rather than focus all your attention on perfecting skills and composition, what is more critical is how the team communicates and works together. In other words, the ‘softer elements’ are key.</p>
<p class="text">This is supported by extensive research conducted by MIT’s Human Dynamics Laboratory, which shows that even above the individual talent included in the team, it is the manner in which a team communicates that directly impacts how successful they will be. In fact, they showed that patterns of communication was the single most important predictor of a team’s success.</p>
<p class="text">Research across a wide set of industries that had similar teams with varying performance demonstrated remarkable consistency in the ‘data signatures’ from the research on the factors that can predict team performance. Successful teams share several common factors around how they communicate.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en18" id="ch06_enx18">18</a></span> There is equality on how much everyone on the team talks and listens, and contributions are kept short and sweet. When they speak team members face each other, connect directly and with energy. Side or back channel conversations complement team discussion, and team members actively explore outside of the team to bring useful information back. In particular, there were three key aspects of team communication that really mattered:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Energy:</span> the number and nature of exchanges between team members – face-to-face communication is more valuable than e-mail, for example.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Engagement:</span> a more even distribution of energy amongst team members.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Exploration:</span> the energy and communication between team members and other teams – high-performing teams, especially those focused on creativity or innovation, seek more outside connections.</p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-189" role="doc-pagebreak" title="189"/>Relatively simple things, including the number of face-to-face exchanges, a team’s engagement outside of formal meetings, how they socialize together in breaks, really makes a difference. The MIT research shows that ideal team players are what they call ‘charismatic connectors’ – people who:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote">circulate actively, engaging people in short, high-energy conversations… are democratic with their time, communicating with everyone equally… listen as much as or more than they talk and are usually very engaged with whomever they’re listening to… connect their teammates with one another and spread ideas around… are appropriately exploratory.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en19" id="ch06_enx19">19</a></span></p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">Amy Edmondson has defined three key strategies that leaders can adopt in order to create an environment of psychological safety:<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en20" id="ch06_enx20">20</a></span></p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Framing work as learning problems, rather than execution problems:</span> each team member’s input has value in helping to solve challenges and navigate uncertainty.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Acknowledging fallibility:</span> creating permission for input from others, using statements and questions that show that the leader does not have all the answers.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Model curiosity by asking a lot of questions:</span> encouraging people to have a voice through questions, creating the need to generate answers.</p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo">Yet Edmondson also recognizes the need for psychological safety to be combined with accountability. Too much accountability without the environment <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-190" role="doc-pagebreak" title="190"/>to enable questions and good discussion creates anxiety and mistakes; an overly open and safe culture with little accountability can lead to complacency and staying with comfort zones.</p>

<p class="text-fo">Team performance is increasingly the critical differentiator between businesses that can compete well in rapidly changing contexts, and those that get left behind. As the best research into high-performing teams demonstrates we give a disproportionately high degree of focus to individual skill and team composition, and far too little attention to group norms and patterns of communication. The smart, agile business redresses that balance.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch06_h2_004"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_048">The challenges and tensions</a></h2>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch06_h3_009">FIST – Fast, Inexpensive, Simple, Tiny</h3>
<p class="text-fo">One of the key mindset challenges around starting small to scale fast often lies in undoing years (decades) of waterfall thinking, which has typically been characterized by comprehensive inputs and gold-plated approaches, and instead learning to take far more iterative approaches to solving problems. ‘Death Star IT’, for example, happens when a large, expensive, proprietary software system is seen as the answer to a business challenge. Ironically, big businesses often seem to feel more comfortable making big decisions about big spends on big solutions than they do about adopting a more open approach that can lead to greater flexibility in the future.</p>
<p class="text">Yet tying yourself into a multiyear, single-solution IT programme creates far greater long-term risk than creating more malleable technology stack solutions that can adapt to changing contexts over time. Significant technology debt can occur when large, inflexible technology systems are customized repeatedly over time to try to cope with inevitable change. This endless patching up and adaptation for jobs that they were not really designed to do simply serves to reduce agility and build up operational risk over time. It’s far easier to be additive with projects, to see future possibilities, to add features, widen the scope, take comfort in building something grand and expensive. Far harder to be reductive, to focus first on the key problem you’re trying to solve, to test assumptions and validate hypotheses as you go, to start small and scale fast.</p>
<p class="text">Dan Ward, an author and specialist in defence acquisition, has captured this approach in the acronym FIST, which stands for ‘Fast, Inexpensive, Simple and Tiny’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en21" id="ch06_enx21">21</a></span> He developed this framework to describe a new approach <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-191" role="doc-pagebreak" title="191"/>for acquisitions and system development building on an original concept from NASA. In the 1990s NASA saw great success with their ‘Faster, Better, Cheaper’ (FBC) series of missions that set out to redefine time, cost and output expectations of their work and included the wildly successful Mars Pathfinder mission (which for the first time ever put a rover on another planet at a fraction of the cost and time of the earlier Viking mission) and the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission (which collected 10 times more data about the asteroid Eros than expected yet was under budget by tens of millions of dollars).<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en22" id="ch06_enx22">22</a></span> FIST defines an approach that uses a small team of talented people working with tight time and resource constraints adhering to a particular set of principles and practices.</p>
<p class="text">Like most great concepts, FIST has much broader application and lots in common, of course, with Lean and Agile. Yet the concept of starting small remains challenging in environments that are used to big upfront investments. The term ‘Minimum Viable Product’ (or MVP) originated in Lean Startup to describe the version of a new product that ‘allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en23" id="ch06_enx23">23</a></span> In effect, it is a first version of a proposition that has just enough features to satisfy early customers, but which can provide useful feedback for development. It’s become another of those terms that are overused yet often poorly understood and applied. The real challenge with MVP and other start small approaches is that they are anathema to organizational practice steeped in comprehensive inputs, business case forecasts and significant upfront investment. Consequently, teams can find that approaches are misunderstood or questioned, and they can easily drift back to more comfortable ways of working. So a prototype becomes a piece of market research (assessing claimed behaviour rather than real behaviour), teams are forced to forecast future outcomes (which restricts learning and means they are back in a linear approach), small becomes quite big (leading to the risk of wasted investment). Starting small then, is a mindset that needs to be appreciated far beyond product and innovation teams. It needs to be understood from the very top of the organization.</p>

<header><h1 class="title" epub:type="title" id="ch06_h1_004">CASE STUDY <span class="emphasis">Amazon Prime Now</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="text-fo">Amazon Prime, the paid subscription service through which Amazon bundles access to premium services including fast delivery and content streaming services, has rapidly grown from its launch in 2005 to become a critical revenue generator for the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-192" role="doc-pagebreak" title="192"/>company. In April 2018 Amazon reported that Prime had more than 100 million subscribers globally.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en24" id="ch06_enx24">24</a></span> Yet the idea for Prime did not come from one of Amazon’s senior executives, but from a software engineer in the company called Charlie Ward who put the idea onto an ideas platform on the internal company website called the Ideas Tool.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en25" id="ch06_enx25">25</a></span> When Jeff Bezos saw the idea, he liked it, and proceeded towards putting Amazon’s full weight behind making it happen.</p>
<p class="text">In 2014, with shopping delivery services such as Instacart having begun to offer a sometimes-same-day grocery delivery service, Amazon decided to launch Prime Now as a way to allow customers to have products delivered to them within one hour for a fee, or two hours for no additional cost. But instead of investing heavily in a nationwide service launch they took an MVP approach and built a basic prototype in 100 days that could be launched in a few parts of New York City. This enabled them to build a low-cost version of the service to test its appeal, learn better how it could work, and limit potentially unnecessary spend.</p>
<p class="text">The first prototype of Prime Now involved a screen within a distribution centre that showed orders coming in via the service. A bell would then ring to alert staff and put into action a group of delivery bikes and riders that were waiting to take the packages straight out for delivery. The MVP worked, and gave Amazon critical learning about how they could deploy it successfully. Less than two years later, Prime Now had expanded to 11 US cities and also to the UK, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Japan and Singapore. As of 2018, almost a million products were available through the service across more than 50 global markets.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en26" id="ch06_enx26">26</a></span></p>
</section>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch06_h3_010">Operational and business rhythm tensions</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Since more traditional linear ways of operating and iterative working like Agile and Lean Startup run at different rhythms, there are inevitable tensions that arise between them when both are running in the same business. These cadence tensions are often under-acknowledged and not planned for but they have the potential to suffocate newer working cultures and practices before they’ve even become established.</p>
<p class="text">The ‘Buxton index’, originated by Professor John Buxton at Warwick University and brought to wider attention by pioneering computer scientist Edsger W Dijkstra, is a lesser-known business concept that defines the length of the period over which an entity makes its plans. Different entities have different planning horizons that they are fundamentally working towards. For a politician seeking re-election it may be the period of government but for a manager striving to reach a quarterly target it will be much shorter. Significant cooperation is required between entities operating to different Buxton indices.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-193" role="doc-pagebreak" title="193"/>Problems therefore arise when there is poor understanding and empathy of divergent requirements and dependencies between teams operating to different indices or horizons. This has to be acknowledged upfront and worked through. Cadence tensions can also occur on a more regular and even day-to-day basis. An agile team might be looking to gain fast customer feedback but be hampered by slow technology release cycles. A finance department might be frustrated that a development team is proposing budgeting cycles or investment methods that are counterintuitive to existing and well-established processes. These tensions also need to be recognized and worked through.</p>
<p class="text">Author Stewart Brand described the concept of pace layering in his book <span class="emphasis">The Clock of the Long Now</span><span class="emphasis">.</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en27" id="ch06_enx27">27</a></span> Pace layering acknowledges the different cadence to which elements of society (fashion, commerce, infrastructure, governance, culture) operate. Gartner used this concept to capture the different rhythms to which layers of technology work – from fastest to slowest: systems of innovation (characterized by experimentation); systems of differentiation (supporting processes that are different from competitors); systems of record (supporting core processes that may not be unique).<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en28" id="ch06_enx28">28</a></span> The concept of pace layering is therefore a useful way of expressing the different needs of various areas of the business. Teams that are closer to customers, making use using systems of innovation and differentiation, needing to iterate and adapt (in other words in the Explore or Execute domains) are likely to be operating at a higher cadence and to shorter horizons. Teams that are focused on incremental improvement of existing, mature propositions and capabilities, using systems of record, or working towards longer-term survival and gain are likely to be operating to a longer Buxton index.</p>
<p class="text">In an era when horizontal collaboration within organizations and across entities is critical for advantage and adaptability, recognizing and mitigating these inevitable tensions is key. A heightened appreciation of the differences and the flexibility needed can lead to a deeper understanding of motivations and so aid better collaboration.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch06_h3_011">Dealing with dependencies</h3>
<p class="text-fo">As agile begins to scale beyond a few teams, the need to manage interdependencies between teams and also establish ways of operating that can mitigate the kinds of tensions that I mention in the previous section, becomes critical. One of the benefits of Spotify’s Squads, Chapters, Tribes model that I discuss in the next section is that the Tribes group Squads together into <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-194" role="doc-pagebreak" title="194"/>logical areas of commonality that helps support more unified working, but also that the Tribe leads can play a key role in managing interdependencies between Squads and also between Tribes. The need to do this is another under-acknowledged but inevitable and critical challenge that will need to be navigated. As are the interrelation and working processes between agile and non-agile teams.</p>
<p class="text">When small teams are likely to have need for multiple different inputs at various stages of the development process the temptation is to bloat the team with people whose skills will be needed only infrequently. Avoid this at all costs. A better way to ensure that agile teams remain small whilst still retaining access to required support and input is to create a structured approach and clear lines to communication. The Agile team onion model, originated by Agile expert and coach Emily Webber, is one way of doing this, and it enables a flow of inputs between the hierarchical, functionally driven part of the business, and the small, agile team.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch06_en29" id="ch06_enx29">29</a></span></p>
<figure class="figure" id="ch06_fig_003">

</figure>
<p class="text-fo">In the model, the core delivery team is kept small and co-located, with very frequent communication between team members. Depending on the outputs required of the team there will likely be developers, a scrum master, designers, perhaps marketing and/or data and analytics. The collaborators can input specialist knowledge and expertise as and when required to support the agile team. These are point people that might sit in a hierarchical function (like HR, Finance, Compliance) and/or be aligned across a number of agile teams but they are there to give support and answers, and <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-195" role="doc-pagebreak" title="195"/>to remove barriers to keeping the agile team/s moving fast. The communication is likely to be regular and they may even attend some agile team meetings or standups, or be in the team a day a week. In some cases, they may be supplier representatives. The supporters are likely to be senior leaders who are overseeing the direction of the team/s (but not telling the team/s what to do), staying informed of progress, ensuring that teams are doing work that feeds in to broader organizational priorities. They may be updated via demos, and communication is regular but less frequent. Since collaborators and supporters may work across multiple teams, it may be possible to create overlapping team onions.</p>
<p class="text">Alongside collaborators and supporters, the product owners or managers are the other key conduit of communication between the hierarchical side and the agile teams. Their job is to help prioritize and evaluate the work that the agile team does (but again, they don’t issue direct orders), align and interpret organizational needs for the benefit of the team, retain and communicate the vision for what the agile team is working on. They play a key role in turning the business strategy into a product strategy.</p>
