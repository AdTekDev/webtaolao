<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_001">Generating a common language around ‘agile’ and ‘digital’</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Terms like ‘agile’ and ‘digital’ have rapidly become overused in businesses and yet there is rarely a common view on what each of these things really means. If you ask a room of 20 leaders this question you will often get 20 different answers (and definitions that often themselves are full of jargon). So it is essential that every business not only develops its own understanding of what agile and digital mean, but that those interpretations are widely understood.</p>
<p class="text">With agile, a company may well develop its own version of Agile process, drawing from the most appropriate facets of different methodologies. That process needs to be well understood and socialized through the business, even with teams that are not ‘doing’ Agile. Beyond this, ‘doing’ Agile needs to be supported through a common approach to developing an agile culture and mindset right across the business.</p>
<p class="text">With digital, it is useful to have a common frame of reference for what it means for the business. As an example, the team that originally led the digital transformation for the services provided by the UK Government (Government Digital Service, or GDS) have described how digital: ‘is not a new function. It is not even a new way of running the existing functions of an organization... It is a new way of running organizations’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en1" id="ch05_enx1">1</a></span></p>
<p class="text">When the key members of that team went to the Co-op group to lead the transformation there, they created a definition that reflected a good combination of people plus technology, plus a need to change the way in which we work: ‘Applying the culture, practices, processes and technologies of the internet era to respond to people’s raised expectations’ (Bracken, 2016).<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en2" id="ch05_enx2">2</a></span></p>
<p class="text">This common language helps support clarity and alignment, but also minimizes misunderstanding.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_002">Creating a compelling vision for change</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Company visions or missions are too often vague platitudes that could well apply to just about any business in any category. Saying that you will deliver exceptional value to your shareholders may sound good in an annual report but does little to inspire employees to go the extra mile. Saying that you will outperform your competitors won’t become a reality if your employees <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-117" role="doc-pagebreak" title="117"/>don’t understand how that will happen. Saying that you’ll be the most customer-centric business in your category when everything that your customers and employees experience feels exactly the opposite serves only to undermine the purpose of having a vision in the first place.</p>
<p class="text">Let’s be clear. A compelling vision needs to be:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">inspirational enough to generate energy and excitement;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">distinctive enough to feel unique;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">simple enough to motivate with clarity;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">challenging enough to feel stretching;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">directional enough to express a point of view about the world/future;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">tangible enough to be a widely understood call to arms.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has talked about the importance of vision and focus in navigating the economic, emotive and resource challenges of a business that has reinvented itself multiple times (from mailing DVDs to content streaming to original content production).<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en3" id="ch05_enx3">3</a></span> Rather than spending too much time thinking about what the competition are doing, Netflix has a long-term point of view about what the future will look like, and is focused on servicing its customers in the best way possible on the journey towards realizing this vision. Following Andy Grove’s famous maxim that ‘only the paranoid survive’,<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en4" id="ch05_enx4">4</a></span> he says, can easily distract you from your own path. Netflix famously publishes its long-term view of how it sees the market and where Netflix will focus.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en5" id="ch05_enx5">5</a></span> Where you choose to focus your attention is a key determinant of organizational orientation. Many incumbents look at competitors and new entrants as they are now rather than envisaging what they could become as technology inevitably improves.</p>
<p class="text">Hastings describes how focus can see a business through a challenging transition such as the one that Netflix underwent when it moved the entire business from DVDs to streaming. Developing an entirely new muscle as a business means that the transformation has to be positioned as essential to survival. You can’t dabble in it. As previously mentioned, when the streaming part of Netflix started to take shape, Hastings deliberately created space between the two (competing) businesses and even went as far as separating the key management meetings to ensure that the streaming business should and could be built to stand on its own merits.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_003"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-118" role="doc-pagebreak" title="118"/>Stubborn on vision, flexible on details</h3>
<p class="text-fo">If a compelling vision needs to be not only inspirational, challenging and distinctive but also simple, tangible and directional, how that vision is brought to life is just as critical in capitalizing on the power that it can have to be all of those things. The stories that grow up in a business through its life about times of success and struggle can be powerful influencers of cultural norms and behaviours in that company. The stories that an organization creates around its vision can be just as powerful in shaping changes in culture and practice.</p>
<p class="text">A transformation vision needs to paint a picture of the positive future state for the business. It needs to connect with employees, partners and customers in ways that are emotional as well as rational. It needs to be something they can believe in. But a CEO standing up with a PowerPoint presentation is not going to transform a business. It also needs to be communicated repeatedly through the words and actions of the leadership team. German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus pioneered the study of memory and created the forgetting curve as a way of expressing the decline in the retention of memories over time. Put simply, information is lost over time unless it is frequently reinforced. Without any prompts to retain newly learned knowledge, its durability can decline rapidly. An example forgetting curve might look <a href="#ch05_fig_001">Figure 5.1</a>.</p>
<figure aria-describedby="ch05_fig_001_details" class="figure" id="ch05_fig_001"><figcaption><p class="figure"><span class="label" epub:type="label">Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">5.1</span> The forgetting curve</p>

<details id="ch05_fig_001_details">

<p class="figure-alt-long">The X-axis spans from 0 to 6, in increments of 1. Memory retention is highest on day 0 and declines over time if there are lesser revisions or prompts. The more the number of prompts on each day, higher the memory retention as the time increase.</p>
</details>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-119" role="doc-pagebreak" title="119"/>The point is that a vision should be strongly directional, but it should also be repeated again and again, articulated, referenced and modelled at every opportunity by the leaders in the organization as a way to reinforce, embed, compel.</p>
<p class="text">Earlier in the book I talked about how organizations become highly proficient at exploiting existing advantage and the inductive and deductive reasoning that comes with that, but are typically poor at abductive thinking, or imagining what the future advantage could look like. Abductive thinking often involves needing to work from incomplete information, but it can draw on creativity and intuition, and result in significant leaps forward (the ‘shaping demand’ jumps that we mentioned earlier). Yet abductive thinking is not divorced from scientific method or data. If we think about Einstein’s work, for example, as much of it was informed by creative leaps of imagination and thought experiments as it was about deduction.</p>
<p class="text">Too often businesses look at the new through the lens of the old. They use analogy and short cuts, which can lead to repurposing rather than reimagining. Asking yourself what the new proposition would look like if you built it from scratch is a good question to ask. Imagining what your business would look like if you launched it today is a good way to challenge your hidden, or toxic, assumptions. First principles thinking is the method of distilling a challenge down to its fundamental truths or atomic components before reasoning back from there in order to redefine what the solution is. It means that your start point gives you the optimal opportunity to create something fundamentally different, and solutions and visions are far more likely to be truly innovative and compelling rather than incremental versions of what went before.</p>
<p class="text">Whilst the organizational and/or transformation vision needs to provide a clear direction that is likely to change only slowly, it shouldn’t preclude the ability to adapt <span class="emphasis">how</span> we achieve that vision. Being agile and doing Agile is not an excuse not to have a plan.</p>
<p class="text">Optimization is important but, just as you’ll never reinvent your business through A/B testing, iteration without direction is foolish. So we need to balance direction with adaptation, conviction with flexibility. To paraphrase Jeff Bezos, we need to be stubborn on vision, but flexible on details.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en6" id="ch05_enx6">6</a></span></p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_004">Problem exploration and definition</h3>
<p class="text-fo">The ability to explore and define problems and contexts with confidence and proficiency is a critical organizational competency in complex adaptive environments. Problem definition frameworks such as the five whys (a technique <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-120" role="doc-pagebreak" title="120"/>drawn from the Toyota Production System that involves asking the question ‘why’ successively five times in order to get to the real route of the problem) are good for both problem solving and quality improvement, but perhaps are best suited for relatively simple or less complicated problems.</p>
<p class="text">For truly complex problems and challenges, we need to be exploring in divergent ways in order to understand situations from different angles and imagine a full range of potential solutions before converging on the solution we believe to be the best.</p>
<p class="text">The CIA’s ‘Phoenix Checklist’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en7" id="ch05_enx7">7</a></span> is a useful problem definition approach used by the agency to enable their agents to understand challenges in a thorough, rounded, flexible and context-free way. The process involves isolating the problem you want to think about, committing yourself to finding an answer by a certain date, and using the checklist to dissect the challenge. The checklist defines a series of questions to aid understanding of the problem, followed by another series of questions to help shape the plan.</p>
<h4 class="head-c">THE PROBLEM</h4>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Why is it necessary to solve the problem?</p></li>

</ul><h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-122" role="doc-pagebreak" title="122"/>The challenge of seeing into the future</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Being able to anticipate what the future might look like can improve our competitive edge, minimize risk and identify opportunities. Having a point of view on the future can also inform our vision for what we need the organization of the future to be capable of, and the strategy for how we achieve that.</p>
<p class="text">Yet forecasting the future with accuracy is notoriously tough. In 1987 psychologist Philip Tetlock was researching how social sciences might contribute to preventing a nuclear apocalypse and he became increasingly frustrated at the many contradictory positions taken by so-called experts, how stubborn these experts were in retaining their point of view even in the face of contradictory evidence, and how easy it was to justify even failed forecasts with excuses. So Tetlock decided to collect forecasts from hundreds of experts (he eventually accumulated 27,500) and establish some clearly defined questions that would enable him to clearly say whether they were wrong or right, and then he waited for 18 years.</p>
<p class="text">The results, published in his book <span class="emphasis">Expert Political Judgment</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en8" id="ch05_enx8">8</a></span>, showed that most of these experts were terrible forecasters. But refusing to acknowledge that the world is simply too complex to forecast, Tetlock more recently set up a new research programme that aggregated thousands of quantifiable forecasts to show the potential of crowdsourced forecasting. In 2011, IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, the US intelligence community’s equivalent to DARPA) began a competitive challenge to find cutting-edge methods to forecast geopolitical events. After four years, 500 questions and drawing on more than 1 million forecasts, Tetlock’s Good Judgement Project won the challenge with forecasts that proved to be so accurate that they outperformed intelligence analysts that had access to classified data.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en9" id="ch05_enx9">9</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The Good Judgement Project<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en10" id="ch05_enx10">10</a></span> draws on a broad variety of forecasters to produce better results, often putting forecasters into teams to enhance results further. Their experiments have shown that even brief training on how to put a probability on a forecast and correct for well-known biases also improves results. The project has shown that forecasting can work, and that some ‘superforecasters’ have the ability to predict events with a degree of accuracy far outstripping chance. They have found that the most successful forecasters were those who exhibited ‘actively open-minded thinking’ or in other words, those who were not afraid to change their minds in the face of fresh evidence, and are happy to seek out contrasting views.</p>
<p class="text">One of the easiest ways to improve the accuracy of predictions is to use the Delphi Method, which draws from these ideas but in a vastly simplified <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-123" role="doc-pagebreak" title="123"/>way. Originally developed as a systematic forecasting technique and based on the principle that forecasts from a structured group of individuals are more accurate than those from unstructured groups, the method involves gathering relevant experts together and going through an estimate–talk–estimate process. The experts answer questionnaires in rounds and after each round a facilitator gives an anonymized summary of the outputs along with the reasons given for the predictions. The experts are then encouraged to revise their judgements in light of the other expert outputs. Undergoing this process with more than one round helps reduce divergence of prediction and convergence around a likely scenario. Median scores of the final round can be used to alight on a final result.</p>
<p class="text">The Delphi Method has been shown to have advantages over other structured forecasting techniques such as prediction markets<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en11" id="ch05_enx11">11</a></span> but at its simplest level, the method speaks to the value that discussion and healthy debate amongst the experts within and outside of your business can have in determining the most likely future scenarios. Let’s not also forget about the importance of avoiding bias and inflexibility through active open-minded thinking, seeking out contrasting views, and not being afraid to change one’s mind when new evidence presents itself.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h1_002" class="case-study" epub:type="case-study" id="ch05_sec_002">
<header><h1 class="title" epub:type="title" id="ch05_h1_002">CASE STUDY <span class="emphasis">DBS Bank and the importance of focus</span></h1></header>
<p class="text-fo">The transformation story of Asian bank DBS is an excellent example of how a singular, directional, well-articulated and well-communicated vision that is executed well can be a true catalyst for positive change. When Paul Cobban joined DBS in 2009 as Chief Operating Officer, it was a midsized Asian bank with around 22,000 employees that was performing poorly. It had the lowest customer satisfaction scores of any bank in Singapore. Cobban tells the story of how, when he got in a taxi on his first day in the job and told the driver that he worked at DBS, the reply was that DBS stood for ‘damn bloody slow’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en12" id="ch05_enx12">12</a></span></p>
<p class="text">New CEO Piyush Gupta defined a refreshed core vision for the bank that was oriented around the concept of ‘Asian Service’. One of the first steps in the digital transformation process was to define exactly what that meant in terms that were tangible and that everyone could easily grasp. This they expressed as respectful, easy to deal with and dependable, articulated as the acronym ‘RED’, which rapidly became part of the company’s vocabulary. Cobban then focused the initial delivery of this vision through a focus on eliminating waste and reducing customer time and defined <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-124" role="doc-pagebreak" title="124"/>a singular metric for success – the customer hour. Cross-disciplinary working on customer journeys and process improvements managed to take out 250 million customer hours of waste per year and the bank went from the bottom of customer satisfaction scores to the top in only one year. In 2016 DBS was named by Euromoney as the world’s best digital bank.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en13" id="ch05_enx13">13</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Not content with that success, the bank underwent a broader, ongoing shift to customer-centred design to create a fundamental change towards working back from the customer. This customer-centric approach to transformation led to the realization that effective digital banking should enable customer transactions in as seamless a way as possible. In other words, banking services and the technology involved should largely be invisible. In keeping with an iterative approach to transformation Cobban identified a series of blockers to change and then ran experiments to remove them as barriers. One of these, for example, involved improving speed of decision-making by removing the practice of people seeking permission from their managers for decisions by e-mail, and replacing it with weekly decision-taking gatherings where employees could get immediate answers or approval on most issues.</p>
<p class="text">This was supported with a fundamental technology reboot to establish a solid, common foundation of core systems that could be built upon. DBS Bank Chief Information Officer David Gledhill has described how he set a mission for the technology team to become the ‘D’ in GANDALF. The first letters of Google, Amazon, Netflix, Apple, LinkedIn and Facebook together spell GANALF, and this mission to be the missing D became one of the most impactful things for the organization:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote">It had a bigger impact on our technology people and many other people in the organization than anything else we’ve done, because it started to make them think about what was possible. It got them to think, ‘We’re not acting like another bank, and here’s how we really start to transform ourselves like a technology company.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en14" id="ch05_enx14">14</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="text-fo">Realizing the key role of culture and mindset in catalysing continuous innovation, leadership teams worked with startups in hackathons and the job of the innovation team shifted towards teaching the wider organization how to innovate. One outcome of this approach was the launch of Digibank, DBS’s mobile-only bank in India, which uses AI and automation to efficiently deliver seamless banking services. Digibank acquired over a million customers in its first year of operations without any of them going into a branch and is projected to have 5 million customers by 2021.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en15" id="ch05_enx15">15</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Between 2006 and 2017, DBS bank more than doubled in size, more than doubled its income and almost doubled its profit, and its market capitalization has tripled.</p>

<p class="text-fo">In order to think big, and continually generate new and exceptional value, senior teams need to recognize that in order to win big, the risk-to-reward ratio that might have worked for the company in the past needs to change.</p>
<p class="text">Even some of the most innovative companies fail – think Google and its successive failures trying to enter the social networking space, or Amazon and the Fire Phone which reportedly cost the company more than US $170 million, and Webstore which was like a competitive service to Shopify. We can think big about our vision and direction, set a course founded in our belief about what the future looks like, and then mitigate as much risk as possible by starting small, experimenting, testing and validating. But we have to accept that if we’re originating truly different and potentially disruptive ideas, we are in effect making a series of bets and plan for a risk profile that allows for that. As Jeff Bezos has said: ‘You’re still going to be wrong nine times out of ten. In business, every once in a while, when you step up to the plate, you can score 1,000 runs. This long-tailed distribution of returns is why it’s important to be bold. Big winners pay for the many previous experiments.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en16" id="ch05_enx16">16</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The point is that in order to win big sometimes we need to lose, but the one thing we can’t be is timid. And we need, of course, to learn from our failures – Google has adapted the technology developed for Google Glass in its self-driving cars, for example.</p>
<p class="text">A good way to challenge teams to think big is to design around challenging customer, supplier or partner needs and use continually changing expectation as a reason to break open existing assumptions, timescales and targets with ambitious stretch goals.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h1_003" class="case-study" epub:type="case-study" id="ch05_sec_003">
<header><h1 class="title" epub:type="title" id="ch05_h1_003">CASE STUDY <span class="emphasis">Lemonade Insurance</span></h1></header>
<p class="text-fo">Digital can disrupt, of course, by bringing the benefit of much greater efficiencies to the customer in ways that are hard for incumbent businesses with legacy systems, processes and thinking to do. But a good question to ask is what would a service or customer journey in the category look like if you could start all over again with a blank sheet of paper? Answering that question, welcoming the challenge of rising customer expectation, and working back from customer need can open up disproportionate advantage.</p>
<p class="text">A good example of this is Lemonade Insurance, a renters and home insurance service centred around the promise of social good and a commitment to ‘instant <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-126" role="doc-pagebreak" title="126"/>everything’, that has used technology and customer-centric thinking to reinvent the insurance customer journey. Launched in 2015, its mission is to dramatically simplify the process of insurance and provide a mobile-first, exceptional and intuitive customer experience.

<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_007">Unknown unknowns</h3>
<p class="text-fo">A simplistic view of transformation sees it simply as a linear transition from A to B, with one-size-fits-all solutions and ways of working and plenty of technology thrown in to facilitate the journey. An intelligent view of transformation takes a more nuanced view of the position of the business, the different contexts in which different areas of the business are operating in order to apply a more sophisticated understanding of the change needed and how we might apply different ways of working to those challenges.</p>
<p class="text">A key method for understanding contexts in transformation better is to consider the level of knowledge that we have about situations and environments but also the level of uncertainty, risk and unpredictability involved. The ‘unknown unknowns’ framework is a simple differentiation that acknowledges that some risks are inherently unknowable, others are dependent on factors such as time, progress and response. The concept was popularized by US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in 2002 who, in response to a question about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction at a Department of Defense briefing, said: ‘Reports that say that something hasn’t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en18" id="ch05_enx18">18</a></span></p>
<p class="text">A useful way of representing this idea is to characterize a quadrant of knowledge based on levels of identification and certainty (<a href="#ch05_fig_002">Figure 5.2</a>).<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en19" id="ch05_enx19">19</a></span></p>
<figure aria-describedby="ch05_fig_002_details" class="figure" id="ch05_fig_002"><figcaption><p class="figure"><span class="label" epub:type="label"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-127" role="doc-pagebreak" title="127"/>Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">5.2</span> Unknown unknowns</p></figcaption><p class="figure-media"><img alt="A matrix between certainty and identification where the horizontal values are certain that is known and certainty that is unknown.

<details id="ch05_fig_002_details">

<p class="figure-alt-long">The four combinations are:</p><ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Identified-Certain: Known-known combination for identified knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Identified-Certainty: Known-unknown combination for identified risk.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Unidentified-Certain: Unknown-known for untapped knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Unidentified-Certainty: Unknown-unknown for unidentified risk.</p></li></ul>
</details>
</figure>
<p class="text-fo">Understanding this balance between level of certainty and identification is key in helping a more sophisticated understanding of the type of response and problem solving that is required across the business and for different contexts. Domains and situations that are stable and well known, for example, are known knowns, suitable for processes and approaches that are concerned with exploiting and incrementally improving existing knowledge and experience. More complex, emergent areas and environments are characterized more by unknown unknowns. They are more likely to be moving fast, new territory, and so require approaches that can test and rapidly learn – you need to feel your way through.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_008">Mapping position and movement</h3>
<p class="text-fo">In <span class="emphasis">The Art of War</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en20" id="ch05_enx20">20</a></span> Sun Tzu set out five factors that define the competitive world and are needed to win any war:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">purpose or mission – shared vision, ideas and expectations;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">landscape – the understanding that we have of the terrain, our situation, opportunities and risks;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">climate – the environment, changes in climatic conditions;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">method – the doctrine, the logistics, rewards, discipline, measures;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">leadership – credibility, courage, intelligence.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-128" role="doc-pagebreak" title="128"/>Whilst several of these constants (like mission, leadership and method) are more evident and obvious in transformation programmes, the focus on landscape is perhaps less so. The need to understand the position from which we are moving and how the terrain and climate might change is often downplayed.</p>
<p class="text">Researcher Simon Wardley (who also developed the pioneers, settlers, town planners concept that we mentioned earlier in the book) has written extensively about the importance of understanding position and movement in order to support strategy and change.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en21" id="ch05_enx21">21</a></span> Hundreds of years ago, he says, Vikings would navigate by telling stories and the modern equivalent of this is the stories that get told within organizations, or the ‘secrets of success’ that allow the fallacy of strategy without positioning. We might set out to win a game of chess but it is the movement during the game that gives us learning as the game plays out, and a good understanding of our current context and position that allows us to apply that learning effectively.</p>
<p class="text">So context-specific gameplay and situational awareness is important. Any half-decent military strategy has a good foundation formed by observation, an understanding of your context and position (your anchor), and therefore movement and the learning that comes from that movement. Most systems maps, business process maps, ‘digital maps’, and mind maps are not maps at all since whilst they may be visual, they have no representation of position or movement. It is the combination of strategy with execution, not either in isolation.</p>
<p class="text">The S-curve chart that we featured in <a href="06_chapter03.xhtml#ch03_sec_001">Chapter 3</a> of this book shows the progression of products and services from their genesis, through custom-built solutions through to ultimately becoming commoditized utilities (<a href="#ch05_fig_003">Figure 5.3</a>).</p>

<p class="text-fo">An organization is complex but can be split into value chains. Value chains can be mapped against this evolution to show position and movement. In order to represent this properly we need to show position and movement relative to an anchor of some kind – if we are to work back from the customer, then the customer is the anchor. On the <span class="emphasis">y</span>-axis is the degree of visibility and proximity to the customer – this gives us position against the customer. The <span class="emphasis">x</span>-axis is plotted against the evolution of products and services based on the phases in the S-curve, and so gives us movement. Some elements of the value chain are naturally closer to the customer and some not, some are in the early stages of evolution and some are highly commoditized. Both customer needs and elements of the value chain may change position as they evolve to become more mature, for example, but the value chain can be linked together on the graph to form a map of position and movement (<a href="#ch05_fig_004">Figure 5.4</a>).</p>

<p class="text-fo">Early stages of maturity are characterized by relatively poor levels of understanding and higher levels of unpredictability. Latter stages are more ordered, stable and mature since we have greater experience and the market is mature. So given these different contexts there is no one-size-fits-all process – Agile and in-house is more likely to be used in uncertain environments in early stages of maturity; processes like Lean that are focused on learning and off-the-shelf services may be more utilized in the middle; and efficiency driving processes like Six Sigma and outsourcing may be used in highly commoditized contexts.</p>
<p class="text">Having mapped the landscape and taken account of the climate (economic patterns) it is possible to create some doctrine, or approaches that are universal (such as a focus on user needs, using appropriate methodologies for different contexts, removing duplication, understanding what to in-house and what to outsource), and also to anticipate and even to manipulate. In order to do this we can use simple patterns such as how increased efficiency and stability can enable innovation since competition increases over time and pioneers can build out from services or use components that have become commoditized to create new value. Or the pattern that success breeds inertia. And higher order systems create new sources of worth.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-132" role="doc-pagebreak" title="132"/>Doctrine leads to leadership or deciding, or context-specific forms of gameplay like where we invest, what we make open-source, and so on. And then we act. ‘Crossing the river by feeling the stones’ (a phrase coined by Deng Xiaoping) means that as we move forwards into uncertainty we need to stay grounded, and feel our way incrementally and always be aware of our position and footing.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_009">The three types of problem</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Another similar but useful way of categorizing the different types of challenges and contexts that a business faces is considering the three types of problem in the world. Originally articulated in a paper on reform in the healthcare industry by Brenda Zimmerman of York University and Sholom Glouberman of the University of Toronto,<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en22" id="ch05_enx22">22</a></span> the framework differentiates between:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">Simple problems – like baking a cake from a mix. There is a recipe.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Complicated problems – like sending a rocket to the moon. They can sometimes be broken down into a series of simple problems. But there is no straightforward recipe. Success frequently requires multiple people, often multiple teams, and specialized expertise. Unanticipated difficulties are frequent. Timing and coordination become serious concerns.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Complex problems – like raising a child. Once you learn how to send a rocket to the moon, you can repeat the process with other rockets and perfect it. One rocket is like another rocket. But not so with raising a child, the professors point out. Every child is unique. Although raising one child may provide experience, it does not guarantee success with the next child. Expertise is valuable but most certainly not sufficient. Indeed, the next child may require an entirely different approach from the previous one. And this brings up another feature of complex problems: their outcomes remain highly uncertain. Yet we all know that it is possible to raise a child well. It’s complex, that’s all.</p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo">Zimmerman and Glouberman go on to contend that it is often the case that complex problems are described as complicated ones, leading people to employ solutions wedded to rational planning approaches. These solutions serve only to miss aspects of complexity and so do not work. The sophistication of our language, theories and models may trick us into an illusion of clarity, ignoring the true complexity of a situation.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-133" role="doc-pagebreak" title="133"/>Yet there are even different shades of complexity. Complex adaptive problems are challenges where a good understanding of individual components or parts of a system does not automatically mean that a whole system is also understandable. This may be because they are dynamic networks of interactions, so the behaviour of the whole is not predicted by the behaviour of the components, and the individual component behaviour and collective behaviour can adapt in response to events. The term ‘wicked problems’ is sometimes used to denote particularly complex challenges that are very difficult to solve because of contradictory, incomplete information and/or changing requirements that may be tricky to recognize.</p>
<p class="text">Again, the key is to understand how the different types of challenges map to your business and the types of response and process required to solve them well. More mature, well-understood, slower moving environments are likely to be characterized by relatively simple problems that can be solved with best-practice processes and checklists. More complicated contexts that are lesser known require expertise and the adept application of experience, learning and knowledge to navigate. Complex adaptive or ‘wicked’ challenges and environments such as those that might come from new, or rapidly developing and changing areas require emergent response characterized by experimentation and prototypical approaches. Given how critical it is to develop a more sophisticated understanding of how your contexts map across the business and the most appropriate response required, let’s consider how these characteristics map across the ‘explore, execute, extend and exploit’ model.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_010">Mapping your contexts</h3>
<p class="text-fo">We’ve discussed how agile transformation involves an appreciation of the different types of approaches that we might use across the business for different contexts. It’s worth repeating in this regard that unlike what many consultancy recommendations suggest, one size does not fit all. Just about every large business needs a much broader appreciation of agile thinking and ways of operating but Agile should not be the default process in the business. Questions about the scalability of agile processes run alongside questions about where we should apply them and, just as importantly, where we should not. In order to determine the answers to these questions we need to take account of the different contexts and environments in which propositions, functions, tasks and areas of the business operate and apply <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-134" role="doc-pagebreak" title="134"/>appropriate methodologies, capability types, roles and ways of working. Context is everything.</p>
<p class="text">The differences between the domains of explore, execute, extend and exploit define the organizational response (<a href="#ch05_tab_002">Table 5.2</a>):</p>
<ul class="list"><li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Explore:</span> in areas and domains characterized by exploration, there are likely to be plenty of unknown unknowns, rapid change and high uncertainty. The problems that the business is trying to solve are complex, the context far newer, the response is emergent by necessity. Iterative and agile working is the only way of navigating this complexity and creating value in this ambiguous environment. This is new capability, future-facing ideas, exploration of entirely new propositions, the kinds of ideas that may disrupt the existing business or take it in a new direction. This is the domain of pioneers – lateral, creative or visionary thinkers who can visualize a different future.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Execute:</span> execution is characterized by more certainty than exploration. The business can largely identify what it doesn’t know (known unknowns) and set out to fill the gaps or to learn. The problems have more variables than areas that are concerned with exploitation and are complicated, so the response needs to be founded in developing and utilizing experience and expertise. The focus is more on test and learn, and iterative working to adapt existing capability, innovate in adjacencies, and commercialize and evolve ideas so that they can be scaled, but the rhythm is not necessarily as fast as domain three. This domain is suited to people who are great at developing models that work in the real world, who can define the operating model or revenue opportunity.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Extend and e</span><span class="strong">xploit:</span> domains that are characterized by exploiting, extending and optimizing existing advantage; the contexts are typically defined by relatively stable slower-moving environments, higher degrees of certainty, and mature and well-established propositions. The challenges are there, but they are characterized more by ‘known knowns’. The need is for common ways of doing things, scalability and best practice. There is value in innovation, but this is focused on innovating on core capability to drive incremental gain or to drive efficiencies and better ways of doing what you do now. This domain is well suited to those people who are exceptional at operationalizing, optimizing and institutionalizing.</p></li>

<p class="text-fo">The agile business needs to be good at all three domains. It needs to allocate sufficient resources to each one, and it needs to apply appropriate processes and thinking. New propositions in the business may mature from exploration to exploitation but as they progress the types of people whom we need working on them will shift, and the approaches and ways of working that should be applied will also likely evolve. But the different ways of operating need to coexist in the same business. One way of working should not suffocate the other. Agile is not just a process; it is a culture. Whilst key parts of the business will need to be DOING Agile, every part of the business will need to BE agile.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch05_h2_004"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_042">Foundational enablers for change</a></h2>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_011">A word on technology and culture</h3>
<p class="text-fo">As I’ll discuss later in this section, agile transformation is people first, technology second. But that shouldn’t diminish the significance of data and technology as enablers and catalysts for agility and change. Many <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-136" role="doc-pagebreak" title="136"/>organizations have made large investments now in technology systems that can take capability to a whole new level, but it remains for most a work in progress. Businesses need to think about their technology stacks and strategy not only in terms of the capabilities that they need now, but also those that they might need in the future. Technology architecture and procurement processes need to take greater account of flexibility, scalability and simplification to reduce complexity and future-proof their infrastructure. Organizations also need to develop forward-thinking data strategies alongside their investment in systems and resourcing. It’s easy to get excited about the possibilities of so-called big data, algorithms, automation and machine learning, but if our data isn’t structured, made available or interpreted in the right way, we will never realize the full potential. Alongside data and technology, we should also consider culture as a key enabler. The wrong culture can kill agile transformation before it has even started. But the right behaviours can catalyse lasting change.</p>
<p class="text">This book is not designed to set out templates for technology architectures or data strategies, but whilst it’s important to acknowledge the importance of these fundamental enablers, it’s also key to understand the elemental role that people and culture play in actually creating the opportunity for real change to happen.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_012">Why do we reject new technology?</h3>
<p class="text-fo">The ability to adapt to and capitalize on the potential benefits of new technologies is clearly central to the modern transformation process and yet it can often be the case that bias can get in the way of successful technology adoption and change. This can even be true for technologies that can make our jobs easier owing to loss aversion (our tendency to prioritize avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains) and our awareness of switching costs (the outlay in time, effort or resource that it takes to switch to something new).</p>
<p class="text">John Gourville of Harvard Business School has written about how these kinds of barriers can explain problems with the adoption of new innovations.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en23" id="ch05_enx23">23</a></span> Their study of new products that are revolutionary to an existing product category or define an entirely new one found that this marketplace failure is two-sided, with consumers systematically undervaluing the innovation and businesses systematically overvaluing the innovation relative to what an objective analysis would show (they called this the ‘curse of innovation’). On the consumer side, innovative new products will likely involve <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-137" role="doc-pagebreak" title="137"/>trade-offs relative to the existing solutions and they require a change in the way the consumers are doing things. On the company side, the degree of investment of time, energy and resource that has already been put into the new innovation means that companies are more likely to overvalue its appeal.</p>
<p class="text">Reference dependence, one of the fundamental principles of behavioural economics, describes the tendency that people have to evaluate outcomes relative to a reference point and then to classify gains and losses against that position (Prospect Theory, Kahneman and Tversky, 1979<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en24" id="ch05_enx24">24</a></span>). Reference dependence can apply to any decision involving risk and uncertainty, but Gourville argues that the ‘curse of innovation’ arises because the consumers and the developers of an innovation have fundamentally different reference points. Since the consumers use the entrenched existing product as a reference point, loss aversion means that they overvalue the existing solution relative to the new one.</p>
<p class="text">The company that came up with the innovative new product, however, uses the innovation itself as its reference point and so systematically overvalues it relative to the entrenched alternative:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote">Having invested time, money, and energy in the development of these products, such innovations are no longer viewed as possibilities, but as realities. For developers, not having the features on which their innovation does better will feel like a shortcoming, or loss, and having the features on which the entrenched alternative does better will be nice to have, but not essential.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en25" id="ch05_enx25">25</a></span></p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">This ‘curse of innovation’ therefore means that consumers often reject new innovations that may well objectively make them better off, and that the developers of the innovation systematically fail to anticipate this rejection. Hence, the innovation fails.</p>
<p class="text">Beyond innovative new products we might apply these concepts more broadly to the adoption of new technologies, ways of working and even to how we approach risk in innovation and to organizational transformation itself. The ‘curse of transformation’ as we might call it, can mean that employees systematically overemphasize the trade-offs that they see in giving up the old way of doing things, and undervalue the benefits of the new solutions. Their reference point is the entrenched status quo, and loss aversion means that they are more keenly aware of what they will lose in the change process. Equally, executives leading the technology implementation or transformation have the new technology or vision for a reference point and so may well systematically fail to anticipate the challenges that they will face in embedding real behaviour change.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-138" role="doc-pagebreak" title="138"/>In effect, both sides here are subject to a kind of ‘endowment effect’ (Kahneman, Knetsch and Thaler, 1991<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en26" id="ch05_enx26">26</a></span>), a bias that happens when we overvalue something that we own regardless of its real market value (meaning, for example, that we can be overly reluctant to part with something for its cash equivalent). In the same way that we place greater value on things that we own (particularly things that have an emotional, experiential or symbolic meaning), we are likely to place greater value on ways of working that we have moulded to become our own, or those that we have contributed significant time and energy in creating meaning that we feel greater ownership and investment.</p>
<p class="text">One example of this is the story of the first mercury thermometers. At the end of the 16th century Galileo Galilei invented the first device that could measure temperature variations – a rudimentary water thermometer. Around 120 years later Gabriel Fahrenheit came up with the first modern mercury thermometer. The Dutch physician Herman Boerhaave thought that the device had great potential and proposed that measurements using a thermometer could be used for diagnosis and to improve treatment.</p>
<p class="text">Yet despite its evident utility it took over 100 years for use of the thermometer and the discipline of thermometry to become widespread. Prior to the mercury thermometer, doctors would largely use touch to determine whether the patient had a high temperature or was suffering from a fever. This qualitative approach was regarded as being able to capture a rich amount of information, more in depth than any tool could generate, and for many years was seen as a superior approach to using thermometry.</p>
<p class="text">In spite of the prevailing inertia to adopting this new technology, a group of researchers persisted in attempting to turn the relatively idiosyncratic opinions and descriptions from doctors into reproducible laws, but it was not until 1871 that a breakthrough happened. In a transformation piece of work (published as <span class="emphasis">On the Temperature in Diseases:</span> <span class="emphasis">A manual of medical thermometry</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en27" id="ch05_enx27">27</a></span>) Carl Reinhold Wunderlich recorded temperatures in 100,000 patient cases, and successfully established not only that the average human body temperature was 37 degrees Celsius, but also that a variation of one degree above this constituted a fever, which meant that the course of illness could be better predicted than by touch alone.</p>
<p class="text">Thermometry represented a giant leap towards modern medical practice but it was not until this study became more widely known and understood that attitudes and patient expectation really started to change. By the 1880s it was considered medical incompetence <span class="emphasis">not</span> to use a thermometer, but until then the much more subjective method of touch remained dominant.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-139" role="doc-pagebreak" title="139"/>The original thermometers may have been large, cumbersome devices and the tool did develop over many iterations but the slow advance of the technology was more down to the challenge of shifting entrenched behaviour and expectation. It’s easy to reject technology that we don’t understand, or technology whose successes we’ve had nothing to do with, or which we fear will detract from our own utility. Andy Grove (of Intel) has called what I have been describing in this section as the ‘10×’ rule, referring to the idea that a product must be at least 10 times better in order to overcome barriers to adoption and switching costs because people tend to underestimate the advantages of a new technology by a factor of 3 whilst simultaneously overestimating the disadvantages of giving up existing solutions by a factor of 3.</p>
<p class="text">Yale physician Gina Siddiqui has described in the <span class="emphasis">Scientific American</span> how the subtlety in technology adoption is actually in how we combine the best of the old with the best of the new. She explains how a children’s hospital in Philadelphia had used quantitative algorithms to identify particularly dangerous fevers. The algorithms proved better at picking out serious infections than the judgement of an experienced doctor. But when the two were combined it outperformed either in isolation: ‘It’s true that a doctor’s eyes and hands are slower, less precise, and more biased than modern machines and algorithms. But these technologies can count only what they have been programmed to count: human perception is not so constrained.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en28" id="ch05_enx28">28</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Similarly, at the 2016 International Symposium of Biomedical Imaging in Prague, a Harvard team developed an AI that could detect cancer cells amongst breast tissue cells with 92 per cent accuracy, almost as good as the trained pathologists who could pick out 96 per cent of the biopsy samples with cancer cells. Yet when artificial and human intelligence were combined 99.5 per cent of cancerous biopsies were identified.</p>
<p class="text">Transformation leaders underestimate the power of loss aversion and switching costs at their peril. Technological and organizational change rarely means forgetting all that we know. More often it is helpful to frame it in that thought of combining the best of the old with the best of the new since this helps people to understand a frame of reference that can help mitigate resistance to change.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_013">Transformation is people first, technology second</h3>
<p class="text-fo">A common problem with digital transformation is that it’s called digital transformation when it is actually business transformation. The word ‘digital’ can sometimes lead to the practice of chasing shiny technology at the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-140" role="doc-pagebreak" title="140"/>expense of the people side of change. One of my favourite studies that speaks to the need to invest in both the technology <span class="emphasis">and</span> people side of change comes from MIT Sloan and Cap Gemini.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en29" id="ch05_enx29">29</a></span> They researched more than 400 large companies over two years looking at how they combined investment in technology-enabled initiatives with leadership capabilities, culture and process initiatives to support transformation.</p>
<p class="text">The study found that companies that invested in both technology and people were not only more digitally mature but on average 26 per cent more profitable – an advantage that was repeated across different industries. What the research also showed, however, was that those businesses that pursued shiny new technologies without the underlying strategies, processes, team structures and cultures to exploit them effectively damaged their business performance and were on average 11 per cent less profitable. Transformation specialist Lucia Adams has articulated the imbalance that often characterizes the way that digital is perceived in businesses: ‘Digital is 10 per cent tech and 90 per cent human. Organizations talk about digital as if it is 90 per cent tech and 10 per cent human.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en30" id="ch05_enx30">30</a></span></p>
<p class="text">With so much focus on new technology and on customer experience, employee experience is often the poor relation. And this is brought into even sharper focus when we consider the huge problem we already have in employee engagement worldwide. Gallup, which has long undertaken wide-ranging research in the area, conducted a data meta-analysis looking at the relationship between team performance and employee engagement.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en31" id="ch05_enx31">31</a></span> The analysis covered 82,000 teams and 1.8 million employees in 230 organizations across 73 countries and 49 industries. Gallup made the point that whilst studies have long suggested a collective intelligence of teams that goes beyond the sum of the individual team members’ abilities, it has always been difficult to find any reliable predictors for team performance. But the meta-analysis reveals that across a wide variation in industry, market and economic environment the relationship between employee engagement and performance is consistent across a set of factors that range from clarity of expectation, sense of belonging, autonomy, doing meaningful work, learning and progression.</p>
<p class="text">When the researchers compared the performance metrics of teams that were engaged against those who were actively disengaged, they found that the top teams had four times the odds of success compared with the bottom teams. More than ever in transformation programmes employee engagement and team performance are absolutely critical: 10 per cent tech and 90 per cent human.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_014"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-141" role="doc-pagebreak" title="141"/>Mapping agile organizational culture</h3>
<p class="text-fo">One of the crucial (yet often under-acknowledged) aspects of transformation is nurturing and enabling the organizational culture that can support greater agility. Teams working in agile ways but surrounded by the wrong kind of culture will encounter the kind of friction that can be potentially disastrous to progress. Trying to achieve greater organizational agility in an environment that does not support an agile mindset and approaches or at least acknowledge how important they are is doomed to fail.</p>
<p class="text">One of the best ways of thinking about organizational culture comes from Edgar Schein (author of <span class="emphasis">Organizational Culture and Lea</span><span class="emphasis">dership</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en32" id="ch05_enx32">32</a></span> and a former professor at MIT Sloan School of Management). Company culture might be defined in terms of the pattern of beliefs and behaviours that grows up around how the business has overcome challenges and prospered. Schein describes it as: ‘a pattern of shared basic assumptions that the group learned as it solved its problems of external adaptation and internal integration, that has worked well enough to be considered valid and, therefore, to be taught to new members as the correct way to perceive, think, and feel in relation to those problems.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en33" id="ch05_enx33">33</a></span></p>
<p class="text">And he defines three key ways in which culture manifests within organizations: observable artefacts, espoused values and basic underlying assumptions:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Artefacts and behaviours:</span> visible behaviours and elements in an organization that might reveal what the company demonstrates as important, but might also be recognized by people who are not part of the culture. This might include physical surroundings and technologies but also language, jargon, stories, myths and practices. This might be thought of as the surface elements.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Espoused values:</span> qualities and rules of behaviour that are advocated by a company’s leadership and management, and show how the organization might represent itself. This might include published things such as a code of conduct, public statements or specific events and material.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Basic assumptions:</span> less tangible, but powerful, underlying determinants of an organization’s attitudes, thought processes and actions. These might include ingrained values and assumptions that are unquestioned, taken for granted, largely invisible and therefore hard to recognize from within.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-142" role="doc-pagebreak" title="142"/>All three of these areas are important to address when attempting to understand and evolve organizational culture.</p>
<p class="text">One of my favourite ways to map organizational culture comes from William E Schneider.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en34" id="ch05_enx34">34</a></span> Schneider wrote about how all organizations are like living, social organisms and so interventions and ideas that see companies as human systems see change as a process of adaptation and learning, and those that are tied to business strategy are more likely to succeed. Component-centred interventions, which are narrowly focused on one or a few elements of the system and are not tied to business strategy, will be more likely to fail.</p>
<p class="text">Schneider describes research that indicates how each organization has a core culture and a dominant way that describes how the leadership believes things should be done and the organization realizes success. This core culture may be described by one of four main cultural archetypes:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Control:</span> success is achieved primarily by gaining and retaining control. The key characteristics of controlling cultures would be stability, order, close monitoring of work, realism, conservative in nature, more predictable, but also high levels of clarity around expectation, unambiguous, decisive when it needs to be, a focus on what’s working. In excess this core culture can lead to risk-aversion, lack of collaboration, inflexibility and rigidity, stifled possibility and innovation, internal politics.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Collaboration:</span> the dominant motive is affiliation, with success coming from working together. The benefits of this core culture include open communication, strong people focus, good cohesion, high levels of trust, good synergy with team and customer needs, the ability to utilize talent and capabilities well, integrated work. The potential downsides are that it may become too lenient at the expense of performance or accountability, or make it harder to implement tough decisions, or become too short term and lack direction or become too overcommitted.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Competence:</span> this core culture is about success through cultivating the capability in the organization and a focus on achievement. The upside potentially comes from high performance standards and technical expertise, high levels of creativity and innovation, an emphasis on demonstrated performance and productivity, thorough decision-making. The potential downsides include lack of pragmatism, undervaluing generalism, a tendency to over-plan, unrealistic expectations on staff, stressed employees.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-143" role="doc-pagebreak" title="143"/>Cultivation:</span> the key to this core culture is growth and potential. It values people, creativity, trust, individual talent, adaptation, inspiration, self-expression, self-actualization, social responsibility, empowerment. The potential risks here are lack of coordination, ignoring real problems, idealism, lack of attention to detail, failure to disengage from existing advantage when necessary.</p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo">Agile practitioner Michael Sahota has usefully described Schneider’s archetypes as a two-by-two matrix, which positions people versus company-oriented businesses on the horizontal axis against reality versus possibility-oriented companies on the vertical axis (<a href="#ch05_fig_006">Figure 5.6</a>).<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en35" id="ch05_enx35">35</a></span></p>

</figure>
<p class="text-fo">The key to utilizing the understanding of these archetypes, says Schneider, is in being aware of where your core culture is rooted and using the strengths of this to achieve success. Yet it is also useful in identifying the potential areas of conflict and tension likely to arise when attempting to become more agile. And also to identify those attributes that may be built upon.</p>
<p class="text">For controlling cultures, high levels of clarity, expectation and decisiveness can really help agility. Conservatism, micromanagement, rigidity, inflexibility, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-144" role="doc-pagebreak" title="144"/>risk-aversion can all badly get in the way. For collaboration cultures, open communication, trust, horizontal working, customer focus, good use of talent are all key to being and doing agile. Lack of accountability, lack of direction, too much over-commitment or short-termism can all kill it. For competence cultures we might want to dial-up on the focus on innovation, creativity, good technical expertise, demonstrated performance and high performance standards. We might want to dial-down on unrealistic expectations, being overly focused on specialist expertise, and the potential of over-burdening teams or employees. For cultivation cultures, the focus on people, trust, adaptation, self-expression and empowerment are all useful to amplify. The lack of attention to detail, lack of coordination, poor problem definition are all barriers. We can summarize these as cultural and behavioural attributes to amplify, and those to adapt (<a href="#ch05_tab_003">Table 5.3</a>).</p>

<p class="text-fo">Developing a high level of awareness of where your organizational culture sits is key to understanding what you need to change, and what you don’t need to change, to support agile transformation. Culture is far more than the visible signals (posters, words on walls, colourful cushions and ping-pong tables) that some seem to think it is. Whilst artefacts and behaviours might be thought of as more obvious, surface elements, it is the basic <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-145" role="doc-pagebreak" title="145"/>assumptions that are deeply embedded, often poorly recognized, and which are therefore powerful drivers of behaviour. We need to recognize what these are, focus on how to unlearn existing behaviours in order to relearn new ones, break existing habits, customs and routines in order to remake new ones. Assumptions and behaviours can either block change from happening at all, or they can be powerful enablers for transformation.</p>
<p class="text">Ask yourself this – where is your core culture rooted? What behaviours might you therefore want to amplify and encourage, and what might you want to adapt or mitigate?</p>
<h4 class="head-c">DEFINING DIGITAL AND AGILE CULTURE</h4>
<p class="text-fo">Organizational culture is clearly key in enabling greater agility yet it is often ignored in transformation programmes or paid lip service, and can therefore act to stifle rather than catalyse effective change. Research conducted by McKinsey, based on a global survey of senior executives, amply demonstrates how powerful cultural and behavioural challenges can be in blocking digital progress.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en36" id="ch05_enx36">36</a></span> When asked what the most significant challenges are to meeting digital priorities, culture and behaviour challenges was named by a third of all the respondents and came top, above a lack of understanding of digital trends, a lack of talent, a lack of IT infrastructure, the misalignment of organizational structure and a lack of senior support.</p>
<p class="text">Selecting adjectives to describe the key characteristics of digital culture is arguably the easy part but since culture and behaviour so fundamentally inform, shape, and influence working practices, strategies, orientation, actions and values, it’s worth summarizing the most important of these attributes to define what we mean when we talk about agile organization culture:</p>
<ul class="list"><li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Flexible, responsive and adaptive:</span> a willingness to change, pivot and flex, the kind of adaptability that builds resilience and momentum (antifragile), the environment to support greater fluidity, a good balance between vision and iteration, avoiding getting stuck in process or managing by proxies and losing sight of real customer need, greater manoeuvrability and responsiveness, an orientation towards greater experimentation, test and learn, a boldness and a less risk-averse culture, the ability to move quickly when necessary.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Customer-centric:</span> customer-centricity is as wide as it is deep, and should be reflected in strategies, processes and structures but more than anything it should be embedded in the culture. It shapes outlook and informs every <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-146" role="doc-pagebreak" title="146"/>decision. It’s one thing to develop fast-feedback loops and be characterized by data-driven decision-making but, as we’ve discussed, we also need to be data-informed. The latter may be good for incremental and continuous improvement but we also require vision, empathy and intuition. We need space to create the new, and a healthy balance between vision, creativity and feedback, and optimization. Data are critical but we should not be slaves to them.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Commercially focused:</span> digital culture is results oriented, quick to explore, determine and assess opportunity, ready to disengage from existing advantage.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Visionary:</span> characterized by a compelling common purpose that is well understood.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Technology-literate:</span> a culture that is founded on comprehensive technology literacy whilst supporting an optimal balance of generalist and specialist expertise, technology as enabler, greater trust and flexibility in technology.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Networked:</span> flow of fresh perspectives into the organization, flow of data through APIs, openness to utilize external resources and build off external capabilities, willingness and ability to capitalize on platform business economics.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Exploring and curious:</span> agile culture is externally facing, inquisitive, lateral thinking, quick to explore technology and customer behaviour trends.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Entrepreneurial and innovative:</span> bias to action, restless, continuous and systematic rather than episodic innovation.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Open and transparent:</span> a working environment characterized by high levels of trust, a growth mindset, productive informality, psychological safety and openness.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Collaboration and learning:</span> a culture that supports knowledge flow and ease of multidisciplinary and horizontal collaboration, embedded reflection and retrospective, continuous and rapid learning from successes and failure.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Autonomy and empowerment:</span> less rigid hierarchy, empowered teams that can move fast, a culture of ownership, a good balance between alignment and autonomy.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">The McKinsey research goes further than simply demonstrating how significant a potential barrier culture and behaviour can be to digital progress. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-147" role="doc-pagebreak" title="147"/>It showed clearly that cultural factors, such as risk-aversion, siloed mindsets and behaviours, correlate clearly with negative economic performance.</p>
<p class="text">Waiting for culture to change organically is simply too slow, Leadership teams need to actively engage in culture transformation, and proactively challenge, promote, reward, mentor, coach, demonstrate and recognize the attributes that can support it.</p>

<h1 class="title" epub:type="title" id="ch05_h1_004">CASE STUDY <span class="emphasis">Culture at Stripe</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="text-fo">Stripe is the hugely successful online payments infrastructure system that in January 2019 landed a US $100 million investment that valued the company at over US $22 billion.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en37" id="ch05_enx37">37</a></span> Co-founder Patrick Collison has summarized the key attributes that they actively seek in the people that they hire: ‘I think the three that really stand out to me are this rigour and clarity of thought, this hunger, appetite, wilfulness, determination, and this… warmth and desire to make people around them better off.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en38" id="ch05_enx38">38</a></span></p>
<p class="text">He describes how they look for clarity of thought and willingness to think the unthinkable and to be misunderstood. Often, he says, companies look for the easiest path, for ‘smoothness’ in transactions, to reduce friction. And yet there is value in ruffling a few feathers.</p>
<p class="text">Consensus-driven decision-making, or the need to get every stakeholder aligned before you can move forwards, is often a problem in businesses that have become large and bureaucratic. It slows everything down. Whilst some decisions may be what Richard Branson has called an irreversible ‘one-way door’ decision, many others are more lightweight choices where it is better to move quickly and course correct than it is to deliberate or water-down the original proposal. Whilst ‘gold-plating’ every decision can be a real problem when trying to create a truly agile business, a culture that can move fast is one that combines high levels of trust, psychological safety and comfort with dissent.</p>
<p class="text">At Stripe they look for people who can combine a determination to run against the status quo and willingness to ‘push against the expected trajectory of non-existence’ with qualities that actually make them nice to work with (‘interpersonal warmth and a desire to make others around them better and just a degree of caring for others’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en39" id="ch05_enx39">39</a></span>). They’re deliberately prioritizing an ability to push through disruptive, big ideas that can protect the future of the business, without being sociopathic about how you do it.</p>
<p class="text">Trust is one of those undervalued attributes in organizational culture, but so is the ability for people to be bold, determined and to really feel that they can say what <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-148" role="doc-pagebreak" title="148"/>they really think in that environment. It is often these kinds of soft qualities that can really enable a company to have the kind of culture that will truly support being bold but also agile.</p>
</section>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_015">The role of trust and transparency</h3>
<p class="text-fo">High levels of trust within an operating environment are critical to moving fast. A lack of trust acts as a catalyst to internal politics and an overly hierarchical way of making progress. When every decision has to go up the hierarchy, across functions or teams, and down the hierarchy again in order to get anything done, the whole business slows down. The ability to work more horizontally depends on greater trust. The ability to make decisions quickly, not just in situations of crisis but also in everyday working, depends on trust.</p>
<p class="text">It’s easy to put words like ‘innovation’, ‘creativity’ and ‘collaboration’ in big letters on the wall of the office but they remain empty words if the culture and behaviours that infuse the working environment don’t reflect these attributes as real priorities. If it’s hard to move fast and be adaptive in climates that don’t support trust we need to actively support and encourage the behavioural aspects that can enable it. A team that is able to support open and frank conversations and be comfortable with healthy conflict will have better ideas and get to solutions quicker. A team that sweeps failures under the metaphorical carpet rather than using them as an opportunity for learning will progress faster and further. A team that ignores feedback and seeks to apportion blame rather than evolve and make headway will slow up and become stuck.</p>
<p class="text">Social network theorist Dr Karen Stephenson has developed what she calls the ‘Quantum Theory of Trust’ as a way of expressing the direct cognitive link that exists between amount of trust in an organization and the ability of staff to deploy tacit knowledge together.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en40" id="ch05_enx40">40</a></span> If we have a conversation with someone whom we trust, we are more likely to remember significant details about that conversation and can more readily pick up from where we left off and immediately build from that exchange. If there is a lack of trust, we might only remember vague details. This triggering of resurgence in mutual memory in high-trust environments immediately opens the potential for new learning and so networks of trust can empower significant cognitive capability. Similarly, social scientists argue that groups with high social capital – good interpersonal relationships characterized by <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-149" role="doc-pagebreak" title="149"/>shared understanding, identity, values and norms along with high levels of trust, reciprocity and cooperation – have significant advantage over those that don’t since the transaction costs are lower.</p>
<p class="text">Yet trust is lacking in so many corporate environments. A 2016 global study by EY that surveyed almost 10,000 employees and over 3,000 soon-to-be employees found that less than half of global professionals have a ‘great deal of trust’ in their current employers, boss or team/colleagues.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en41" id="ch05_enx41">41</a></span> Interestingly, the top five factors that were contributing to respondents’ lack of trust in their employers were: unfair employee compensation; unequal opportunity for pay and promotion; lack of leadership; high employee turnover; and a work environment not conducive to collaboration. When participants were asked about the most important factors in determining the level of trust to place in their employers, delivering on promises came out top, followed by job security, fair compensation, open and transparent communication, and equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="text">Alongside all the critical policy standards around diversity, equal opportunities and fair compensation, transparency in particular can play a key role in promoting greater trust since open communication breeds more open communication, which supports better information flow and productive relationships. It’s a positive compounding loop. Too much self-orientation, however, or the feeling that another person or team is being closed or hidden, or the concern that the person or team lack reliability in delivering what they say they will, does not support effective cross-disciplinary or inter-team working.</p>
<p class="text">A number of fast-growing businesses have recognized the importance of transparency and put it front and centre of their cultural values. Social and content marketing technology business Buffer, for example, has transparency as one of its nine key values on which it bases its culture:<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en42" id="ch05_enx42">42</a></span></p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Always choose positivity and happiness.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Default to transparency.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Have a focus on self-improvement.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Be a ‘no ego’ doer.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Listen first, then listen more.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Have a bias towards clarity.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Make time to reflect.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Live smarter, not harder.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Show gratitude.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-150" role="doc-pagebreak" title="150"/>Again, it’s very easy to write down a bunch of values but it is how the business lives and breathes them that really make them work. The cultural values should be reflected in some key areas:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">The visible behaviours of the leadership team and employees.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">What the leaders pay attention to, and select to measure.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">The response of leadership to significant challenges.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">The priorities and choices that the business chooses to make, and how resources are allocated.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">How staff are rewarded, incentivized and recognized.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">The behaviours that support status within the organization.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">The routines, expectations, habits and rituals of the business.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">The stories that have grown up with the business.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">The formal statements, releases, documentation.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">The design and feel of the physical working environment.</p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo">Buffer, for example, has moved to make revenues, user numbers and performance completely open as a way of supporting its ‘default to transparency’ mantra. It publishes its investor update and monthly performance reports on its blog. It has also made efforts to encourage transparency in e-mail communication (every e-mail sent can be seen by team mates) and in personal development. More controversially, it also initiated an ‘open salary’ concept based on a formula that made remuneration for employees completely transparent.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en43" id="ch05_enx43">43</a></span> Buffer has even created a ‘transparency dashboard’ that aggregates information on the equity formula, details of fundraising, salaries, real-time revenues, pricing and how the money is spent, diversity information, open source code, an open product roadmap, content plans, and even the books that the team is reading.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en44" id="ch05_enx44">44</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Co-founder Joel Gascoigne has written about how sticking to radical transparency has probably been one of the most frightening but exciting things that the company has done. But it has shown unique potential to empower and inspire the team, to drastically break down barriers since every idea or new direction is shared early, even before it’s completely formed. As he describes it, transparency is such a powerful value for Buffer for a particular reason: ‘Transparency breeds trust, and trust is the foundation of great teamwork.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en45" id="ch05_enx45">45</a></span></p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-151" role="doc-pagebreak" title="151"/>This kind of approach to transparency is a supremely confident thing to do. And there’s nothing like confidence for inspiring belief. But it also dramatically improves the ability of the organization to move and develop fast, and to adapt and learn at scale.</p>
<section aria-labelledby="ch05_h1_005" class="case-study" epub:type="case-study" id="ch05_sec_005">
<header><h1 class="title" epub:type="title" id="ch05_h1_005">CASE STUDY <span class="emphasis">Monzo and transparency</span></h1></header>
<p class="text-fo">In a very similar way to Buffer, challenger bank brand Monzo has placed transparency at the heart of its cultural and strategic values. The fact that Monzo is a financial institution operating in a highly regulated environment makes this even more challenging but inspiring. Monzo’s approach is echoed by other fast-growing fintech businesses like Lemonade Insurance whom I mentioned earlier in the book and whose ‘transparency chronicles’ openly describe the highs and lows involved with its rapid growth.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en46" id="ch05_enx46">46</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Like Buffer, Monzo says that its aim is to ‘default to transparency’, and says that this must mean that the company puts in place policies and practices that bring information out into the open as often as possible: ‘Over time, transparency becomes the norm, and we create a “burden of secrecy”: an argument must be made to keep something secret, rather than to make it open – a very different approach to most organizations.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en47" id="ch05_enx47">47</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Monzo describes how transparency builds trust, and how a lack of trust can lead to unhappy, unproductive teams and poor employee retention. Transparency also helps build trust externally with customers, which is critical in ensuring that Monzo is seen as a reliable, safe place to bank: ‘Being internally transparent forces our external transparency to also be genuine.’</p>
<p class="text">Transparency, says Monzo, also helps teams make decisions independently and so empowers autonomy. Success comes from hiring people who are smarter than you and then letting them get on with their tasks, making decisions independently whilst adhering to company goals and policies, and this can only happen when teams have the full range of information to hand.</p>
<p class="text">Being transparent by default also helps remote workers to keep up to speed, and onboard new team members effectively and speedily by having all relevant documentation open and available to read. It also supports personal development by giving everyone an unfiltered view of both the good and the bad stories involved with building a rapidly growing business.</p>
<p class="text">Monzo supports this default to transparency in a number of key ways. Meetings are open for anyone from the company to join and anyone can put anything on the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-152" role="doc-pagebreak" title="152"/>agenda for the weekly all-hands. Every team updates the rest of the business weekly on progress and challenges. Like Buffer, every e-mail sent can be read by anyone in the company by default. This applies to even hastily written replies or forgotten attachments, as a way to avoid employees feeling like they need to present a sanitized or corporate version of themselves (a phenomenon known as the ‘Chilling Effect’, which describes the tendency people have in social network sites to constrain the self they present online due to peer-to-peer surveillance<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en48" id="ch05_enx48">48</a></span>). Employees are also encouraged to use open Slack channels to communicate wherever possible. Whilst critically sensitive information such as specific customer or employee details is not made completely open, the default is always to be transparent.</p>
<p class="text">Like Buffer, Monzo has created a transparency dashboard that openly brings together information on investment ethics, funding, user community suggestions, financial performance and an open product roadmap. In September 2018, Monzo hit 1 million customers, little more than three years after launching.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en49" id="ch05_enx49">49</a></span></p>
<p class="text">For years, companies have believed in advantage through secrecy and closed firewalls but companies like Monzo have taken a very different and quite radical approach to openness and inclusiveness with their customers. Whilst confidentiality remains important in select, critical areas, the default to transparency exhibited by companies like Monzo, Buffer and Stripe is helping to support an unprecedented level of trust within the businesses that choose to adopt it and enabling them to be truly agile, and gain culture advantage, not just competitive advantage.</p>

<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_016">High-velocity decision-making</h3>
<p class="text-fo">The way in which a company makes decisions is a powerful but underappreciated potential barrier to everyday agility. In many businesses this is typically characterized by one-size-fits-all decision-making and lengthy business case documentation or PowerPoint presentations filled with extensive projections based on very little. Copious executive hours are spent crafting PowerPoint presentations to present at internal meetings or e-mail around. Approvals take multiple meetings to secure everyone’s approval before anyone can move forwards. Discussions go back and forth; decisions get delayed; progress is slow. It’s a painful, broken process.</p>
<p class="text">Many leaders make decisions in much the same way regardless of the context of what the decision is for. Sir Richard Branson has pointed out that not every decision is the same and has described the difference between what he calls ‘one-way door’ and ‘two-way door’ decisions. A one-way door decision is the type that is irreversible, where detailed consideration, consultation <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-153" role="doc-pagebreak" title="153"/>and discussion may be necessary. Once you go through a one-way door you are committed so you need to be sure that this is the right thing to do. Yet these types of choices are actually few and far between. Many other decisions will be a two-way door, where it is better to make the decision quickly in order to make faster progress: ‘Even if they seem definite, they are actually reversible. You can walk through the door, see how it feels, and walk back through to the other side if it isn’t working.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en50" id="ch05_enx50">50</a></span></p>
<p class="text">For a business trying to be innovative and nimble, says Sir Richard, the leadership team will need to make plenty of two-way door decisions. Jeff Bezos, in his 2016 annual Amazon shareholders letter described this difference as 70 per cent and 90 per cent decisions. He also notes how many larger, well-established enterprises make high-quality decisions, but make them slowly, adopting a one-size-fits-all approach to decision-making, which is typically characterized by waiting until you have 90 per cent of the information you need before making your choice. In many cases, he says, many less complex or easily adapted decisions can be made with around 70 per cent of the information you wish you had. But it’s more advantageous to make the decision and course-correct if necessary than it is to slow everything down.</p>
<p class="text">Similarly, a culture of consensus-driven decision-making where all stakeholders need to be aligned before you move forwards with something can also slow the company down. Amazon uses a phrase ‘disagree and commit’ as a useful way of acknowledging disagreement whilst enabling the project to progress rapidly. Bezos gives the example of when he disagreed with an Amazon Studios investment in an original content production project that he believed to be too complicated and not interesting enough. The team were all aligned that they wanted to move forwards with it though and so Bezos wrote back immediately saying: ‘I disagree and commit and hope it becomes the most watched thing we’ve ever made.’ His point is that if the team had had to convince him rather than just getting his commitment the decision-making process would have been a lot slower.</p>
<p class="text">The Amazon approach to business case generation and approval is also instructive. Bezos famously banned PowerPoint (as long ago as 2004) as a way of presenting a case, saying: ‘The traditional kind of corporate meeting starts with a presentation. Somebody gets up in front of the room and presents with a PowerPoint presentation, some type of slide show. In our view you get very little information, you get bullet points. This is easy for the presenter, but difficult for the audience.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en51" id="ch05_enx51">51</a></span></p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-154" role="doc-pagebreak" title="154"/>Instead, Amazon meetings are structured around a six-page explanatory ‘narrative’ pitch (shortened for less in-depth decisions). The first 20 minutes of a team meeting is spent in silence reading the pitch, after which the presenter fields questions and a decision is made. Says Bezos: ‘The reason writing a 4-page memo is harder than “writing” a 20-page PowerPoint is because the narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what’s more important than what, and how things are related.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en52" id="ch05_enx52">52</a></span></p>
<p class="text">These ‘working backwards’ documents (as we discussed earlier in the book) are always structured in the same way, giving the context or question, the approaches to answer the question (by whom, by which method, and their conclusions), why this attempt at answering the question is different from previous approaches, and what’s in it for the customer and the company. The approach allows for deeper thinking, better decision-making, better use of time, and also reduces the role and influence of politics in the process.</p>
<p class="text">Many large businesses are choked with PowerPoint presentations. The ‘narrative’ approach is a simple way to make better decisions faster. But beyond this, this kind of high-velocity decision-making enables larger companies to act and behave like much smaller ones.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_017">The role of autonomy, mastery, purpose</h3>
<p class="text-fo">When our job is to empower change and bring people on the journey with us it’s critical to recognize the power of intrinsic motivators in creating the kind of environment that can support engaged, motivated employees who are doing their best work. In his book <span class="emphasis">Drive: The surprising truth about what motivates u</span><span class="emphasis">s</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en53" id="ch05_enx53">53</a></span>, Dan Pink makes a compelling case (supported by plenty of academic studies) for the limitation of money as a motivating factor in the workplace and instead for the power of three key intrinsic motivators:</p>
<ul class="list"><li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Autonomy:</span> the ability to make decisions in the areas that we are responsible for that can make a difference.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Mastery:</span> the ability to learn, continually improve, to see and be rewarded for progress.</p></li>
<li><p class="list"><span class="strong">Purpose:</span> doing meaningful work that is important to use, working towards a vision or purpose that we believe in.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">This intuitively makes a lot of sense but it’s remarkable how many high-performing, agile organizations that I have worked with have these three <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-155" role="doc-pagebreak" title="155"/>attributes running through their DNA. They typically have cultures that are characterized by high levels of empowerment and ownership. They have processes and expectations that support continuous learning, and ways of connecting employees to the impact of their work and the progress that is being made. And the organization has a clear, well-understood mission that its staff really believe in. Leadership teams often focus on extrinsic motivators and rewards as drivers of change, yet these powerful intrinsic motivators should be front and centre of any cultural and agile change programme.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_018">Creating meaningful work</h3>
<p class="text-fo">There is great potential in making people’s work meaningful, just as there is great detriment in employees feeling as though what they are doing every day has little or no purpose. When staff are connected with the impact that they are making, when they can feel that they are generating real, tangible value in what they do, when they can see visible progress in their learning and their outputs, employees feel more motivated, are more productive, and are happier in their work.</p>
<p class="text">Yet there are a surprising number of people who actually do believe that the work that they are performing lacks any contributive value. A 2015 YouGov poll in the UK, for example, found that 37 per cent of British workers think that their jobs make no meaningful contribution to the world.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en54" id="ch05_enx54">54</a></span> And one conducted by Dutch firm Schouten &amp; Nelissen found that out of 1,900 workers surveyed 40 per cent did not think that their work was useful.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en55" id="ch05_enx55">55</a></span></p>
<p class="text">These kinds of roles, where the people doing them feel that they are largely pointless and that they don’t seem, at least to the outsider, to really accomplish very much or make any discernible difference in the world, are what author David Graeber has termed ‘bullsh*t jobs’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en56" id="ch05_enx56">56</a></span> Graeber’s definition of a ‘bullsh*t job’ is: ‘a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en57" id="ch05_enx57">57</a></span></p>
<p class="text">This is, he believes, a great tragedy. A situation that generates resentment and even quiet rage amongst the notable numbers of people (he believes around two-fifths of jobs in the developed world) who work harder than they should at jobs that they secretly believe should not exist. ‘Huge swathes of people, in Europe and North America in particular, spend their entire working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-156" role="doc-pagebreak" title="156"/>performed. The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually no one talks about it.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en58" id="ch05_enx58">58</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Graeber’s assertion that it seems to be a general rule in our society that the more obviously someone’s work benefits other people, the less likely they are to be paid well for it seems to hold some weight (think teachers, nurses, police for a start). But even if there is little research to show exactly how many people in more office and factory-based working societies feel this way, it is certainly intuitively right that large swathes of working people feel relatively unengaged, uninspired or, worse, frustrated by their jobs.</p>
<p class="text">A well-known 2013 global Gallup survey of more than 230,000 workers found that only 13 per cent of workers feel engaged by their jobs (this was described as being psychologically committed to their jobs and likely to be making positive contributions). A further 63 per cent are ‘not engaged’ (which is characterized as lacking motivation and putting less effort in, especially when it comes to discretionary effort towards organizational goals. And 24 per cent are ‘actively disengaged’ (that is, unhappy, unproductive and liable to spread negativity). Gallup believes that this equates to roughly 900 million not engaged and 340 million actively disengaged workers around the world.</p>
<p class="text">Notwithstanding how tragic this picture is, businesses are allowing themselves to be significantly disadvantaged by underengaged and underperforming employees, by failing to create meaning in the work that staff are undertaking, and connecting their input to visible outputs, improved company performance, progress and learning. The businesses that can fully engage their staff and can create that connection can benefit from the kind of enthusiasm and motivation that will create genuine advantage, better ideas and more creative and productive outputs.</p>
<p class="text">And enthusiasm is surely one of the most underrated attributes employees can have. Enthusiasm is what encourages them to go further in search of working solutions to problems, to think harder about challenges, to work better with peers. The difference between an average team and a high-performing one in terms of productivity and outputs is often down to the discretionary effort of the team members. The work that people could put in above and beyond the minimum required. The difference between what people might want to do if they believe in the value of what they are doing, and what they have to do if they don’t. You cannot expect to get discretionary <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-157" role="doc-pagebreak" title="157"/>effort when people feel disconnected from their job and that the work contributes little anyway.</p>
<p class="text">Simple principles that sit at the heart of agile working, when done well, can help alleviate this disconnection. Having a clear sense of direction and meaningful vision. Being able to make decisions in the areas that you are responsible for and feeling that your opinion matters. Being part of a small team that is communicating well and producing regular delivery of value. Finding ways to tangibly enable team members to see that value and progress that they are creating and positively reinforce the good work. Not overburdening the team through sensible de-prioritization. Being able to take a step back and reflect on what’s working and what’s not, and the feeling that you are continually learning. These may feel like minor working procedures but are actually fundamental to connecting people with meaningful and highly productive work.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_019">The power of purpose-driven</h3>
<p class="text-fo">I have discussed the importance of creating meaning for employees in the work that they do, and organizational direction and a higher organizational purpose can play a key role in getting the kind of engagement that can lead to fulfilling roles for staff but also exceptional performance, discretionary effort and forward momentum.</p>
<p class="text">A higher organizational purpose is different from a company mission or vision. A great example of this is the diversified energy business DTE Energy and how they recovered from a financial crisis point in 2008 to triple their stock price in under 10 years and not only survive but achieve some quite spectacular results. Robert Quinn and Anjan Thakor (authors of <span class="emphasis">The Eco</span><span class="emphasis">nomics of Higher Purpose</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en59" id="ch05_enx59">59</a></span>, and from the University of Michigan and Washington University respectively) have defined this higher purpose as going beyond economic exchanges: ‘It reflects something more aspirational. It explains how the people involved with an organization are making a difference, gives them a sense of meaning, and draws their support.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en60" id="ch05_enx60">60</a></span></p>
<p class="text">When DTE was hit hard by the 2008 recession, new CEO Gerry Anderson knew that he had to get more from his employees if the company was to survive. Earlier surveys had shown that the staff lacked engagement. They were stuck in old behaviours and not applying the full potential of their creativity, intuition and understanding. Previous initiatives around incentives, supervision and training had failed to really address the challenge.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-158" role="doc-pagebreak" title="158"/>Inspired by a visit to a USAA call centre in which he had observed truly committed employees going about their work with enthusiasm and positivity Anderson sought to apply the lessons he had learned. The USAA staff had undergone an intensive orientation programme designed to really connect them with both the purpose of the organization and their own purpose. This was then continually reinforced through all hands meetings and other staff forums that enabled people to ask questions and share ideas.</p>
<p class="text">Anderson framed a new purpose for DTE Energy based on the contribution and value that the company brought to its end-customers and the well-being of the wider community: ‘We serve with our energy, the lifeblood of communities and the engine of progress.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en61" id="ch05_enx61">61</a></span> Anderson brought this to life with a video that showed customers of DTE including teachers and doctors and the impact of the work that DTE staff were doing. This contribution had never been acknowledged before and it had a profound emotional impact on the staff. Anderson framed the challenge that the company was facing with honesty and in ways that demonstrated his belief not only in the potential of discretionary energy but also of his employees’ ability to deliver it:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote">We went to our people and told them that this was a very big event we were facing. We couldn’t promise how it would turn out, but we would promise one thing. We promised that the last lever we would pull to protect the integrity of the company would be a layoff. That we’d do everything in our power to prevent it. But in return, we said there’s something we need to ask of you. You need to go to bat for this company with an energy level and an intensity and a level of creativity that you never have before.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en62" id="ch05_enx62">62</a></span></p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">Anderson’s point is that we only really give our extra energy to things that we really care about and believe in. It was only by turning people’s energy outwards and generating meaningful aspiration about the purpose that the company was fulfilling in the wider community that that extra energy could be empowered. Authors Robert Quinn and Anjan Thakor describe how every decision that the company makes should be played through the lens of this purpose in order to make it truly authentic, and how goals should be framed as contributive goals rather than ego-driven goals, so that staff know exactly what the work they are doing is contributing.</p>
<p class="text">Author Dan Pink has explained this as how we should think about purpose not only in terms of the grand, visionary purpose that a business might set out to establish a compelling direction (Purpose with a capital ‘P’) but also the importance of purpose (with a small ‘p’) in the sense of employees <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-159" role="doc-pagebreak" title="159"/>knowing and feeling that they are making a valuable daily contribution.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en63" id="ch05_enx63">63</a></span> In other words: to personalize purpose. Timely and salient feedback on what they are doing in the context of that purpose is one way of achieving this. But one of the simplest ways is to put your people in front of customers and for them to actually talk to customers rather than read about them in research reports or observe them remotely from behind a screen in a focus group lab. That opportunity to hear directly about the impact (good and bad) of what you’re doing creates the kind of unique connection with the work that can’t come from anywhere else.</p>
<p class="text">It’s worth noting that for every positive there is a negative and purpose is no different. Nokia is an example of how a negative, fear-driven sense of urgency can lead directly to a company’s downturn. Research conducted by Quy Huy, a professor of strategic management at INSEAD, and Timo Vuori, assistant professor at Aalto University in Finland,<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en64" id="ch05_enx64">64</a></span> reveals that during their decline a climate of fear inside the organization made it hard for managers to pass bad news back up the line and froze coordination between senior and middle management. Rather than catalyse motivation, stretch targets actually generated inertia as communication between layers of management broke down, with executives not wishing to be told they were not ambitious enough or were failing to perform, and competition for resources increased. The researchers conclude by saying that leaders of transformation need to develop a collective ‘emotional capability’ in their companies and be sensitive to the impact that emotion can have on culture and performance.</p>
<p class="text">Contributive goals. Not ego or fear-driven urgency. That’s what catalyses discretionary energy and effort and drives real change and performance. People want to believe. They want to do work that means something: work that matters. That’s why, when it’s done right, it is properly transformative.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_020">Creating the space</h3>
<p class="text-fo">One of the critical challenges in transitioning to a truly ambidextrous, bimodal organization is creating the space to try new things, be more experimental, and continuously develop the new whilst still managing the current. As I mentioned before, this is like trying to change the wheels on the car as you’re driving along. But without creating space for the new to emerge, nothing will really change.</p>
<p class="text">We need this to happen at both a strategic, organizational level and an everyday operational level. The former requires support from the very top, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-160" role="doc-pagebreak" title="160"/>and clear enablement through structures and process. The latter requires management and employee empowerment, and a culture that supports it.</p>
<p class="text">There are three clear ways in which we can start to free-up space within the organization to allow more resourcing, focus and time to be put towards generating emerging models and ways of working:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Ruthless and systematic de-prioritization:</span> most companies are terrible at de-prioritization. It’s a lot easier to be consistently additive – to expect your employees to do what they did before whilst also taking on new projects and initiatives. It’s a lot harder to ask what we’re going to stop doing in order to free-up time and space to take on new tasks. But there’s no getting away from the fact that without some level of de-prioritization it is extremely hard to consistently create the kind of space that an agile, bimodal organization needs. Freeing-up space is a continuous process – we need to build-in ways to systematically disengage and de-prioritize as much as we do for originating and developing new propositions.</p>
<p class="text">One of the principles of sprint wo-rking in Agile is that you don’t overload the team. If short-term tasks come in, wherever possible the team prioritizes them into the next sprint backlog. If they have to take it into the sprint, then they de-prioritize something else. This is a fundamentally sensible principle that has much broader potential application. Short-term priorities are inevitable, but they are also no excuse for overloading our employees. Work overload is not good for employee well-being, but it also doesn’t help people to do their best work, be their most productive, keep their focus, or minimize time on superfluous communication.</p>
<p class="text">At an organizational level, there is a need to get better at disengaging from existing propositions that are declining in advantage, and to create structures that enable an unencumbered focus on experimentation and the generation of new value. So it makes sense to create a system of regular reviews to identify propositions that are due to be retired and a process to manage disengagement.</p>
<p class="text">The duplication of initiatives or work is a surprisingly common waste of effort and time in large organizations, as multiple projects are initiated in separate areas that partially or entirely cross over. Senior leaders are often entirely unaware of it. So it helps to periodically audit projects being run across the business, remove duplication and prioritize based on alignment with organizational purpose and vision, potential impact, time, cost and urgency. Ironically, it’s often the case that senior teams that are <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-161" role="doc-pagebreak" title="161"/>most risk-averse have the larger number of projects on the go – they want to hedge their bets. But in doing so they are opening up the potential for greater dilution and duplication of effort and resources. Better to have clarity of focus on the big but broad areas of opportunity and then align resources around experimentation and rapid learning in those areas.</p></li></ol>
<ol class="list-number" start="2"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Challenge the defaults:</span> at an operational level, one of the most powerful ways to free-up time and resource is to challenge embedded assumptions about how things should work day to day. One of my favourite examples of this is a powerful way to change the defaults around meetings that was originated by leading content marketing technology business Percolate. The company has created ‘six rules of meetings’, which are designed to maximize the usefulness of all gatherings in the business. Employees should question whether they need a meeting at all, ensure there are no unnecessary attendees or spectators, state the purpose of the meeting upfront, assign tasks, and avoid bringing computers and phones along.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en65" id="ch05_enx65">65</a></span></p>
<p class="text">One of the rules is that meetings should be 15 minutes by default. Most meetings in businesses are scheduled in blocks of an hour (this is what Silicon Valley startup mentor Paul Graham called the ‘manager’s schedule’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en66" id="ch05_enx66">66</a></span>) and somehow, they always expand to fill that time whether they really need to or not. Parkinson’s law is the famous adage that: ‘work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en67" id="ch05_enx67">67</a></span> As organizations become larger and more complex this seems to somehow become truer. Executives’ diaries fill up with hour or two-hour meetings so that they end up going from one to the next to the next and arrive at the end of the day wondering when they can get started on the real work. Imagine the power of making every meeting throughout a business 15 minutes by default. Fine if it needed to be longer, but just changing the default will ensure meetings are run more efficiently and free-up countless hours of executive and employee time.</p>
<p class="text">Another default that is often worth challenging is reporting. It is another common area of duplication and unnecessary or low-value work. Staff often spend long hours populating detailed reports to send to executives when a far more focused summary would suffice. Our tendency when reporting upwards is to over-deliver in our enthusiasm to impress or to ensure everything is covered. Managers don’t correct the over-delivery since there is comfort in comprehensive information, just in case. One company that I consulted with had a real problem with freeing-up <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-162" role="doc-pagebreak" title="162"/>employee time, so we conducted an audit of reporting through the business and found that there was one team spending two days out of every five producing a weekly report that few if any executives actually read.</p>
<p class="text">So challenge the default. If you suspect that there is an unnecessary level of detail in the reporting mutually agree to cut it out. If you suspect that no one is reading the information you are providing, then stop providing it. Colleagues will soon shout if it is still needed, but that gives you an opportunity to revisit how much information is really necessary. Ask for forgiveness, not permission.</p></li></ol>
<ol class="list-number" start="3"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Starting small:</span> there are a number of widely cited examples of businesses that give their employees dedicated time to explore and develop new propositions. We’ve all heard of Google 20 per cent time, or 3M’s ‘Time to Think’ or Facebook’s regular 24-hour hackathons. These approaches are extremely useful in creating the space to nurture early-stage ideas, but are relatively rare. Yet in the absence of structured programmes there is much that can come from an approach that everyone can adopt – starting small in creating more space in the operational day to day. Just as great things can come from small empowered teams, so amazing outputs can come from small segments of time that are integrated into the fabric of the working week.</p>
<p class="text">Here’s an example. Scientists Andrei Geim and Kostya Novoselov won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 2010 for their creation of graphene, which has been described as the scientific find of the century.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en68" id="ch05_enx68">68</a></span> Graphene is the ‘wonder material’ comprised of a single layer of carbon atoms and is the thinnest and strongest substance known to science. It is about 200 times stronger than the strongest steel and it already has an almost limitless number of applications.</p>
<p class="text">But the creation of graphene didn’t come from a structured long-term research programme. It came from mucking about in the lab. Geim and Novoselov ran ‘Friday night experiments’, a small amount of free time on Friday afternoons when lab staff could work on scientific experiments not related to their day job. In one such session they were playing around with sticky Scotch tape, using it to peel off layers of graphite flakes until they were only a few atoms thick. They realized that they could actually use this method to get down to the thinnest possible layer, just one atom thick, and create a material with completely unique properties.</p>
<p class="text">My challenge is this: if Andrei Geim and Kostya Novoselov can win the Nobel Prize from a small amount of time on a Friday afternoon, surely every team can find an hour a week to experiment and learn. When <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-163" role="doc-pagebreak" title="163"/>they won their Nobel Prize, the Nobel committee noted the way in which the scientists used playfulness in the way that they work together. There should be more space for playfulness in business. Without it, we might never come up with the breakthrough ideas and concepts that can not only enable creative leaps forwards, but can quite possibly save our business.</p></li></ol>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_021">Fixed and growth mindsets in leadership</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Stanford Psychologist Carol Dweck’s concept of fixed and growth mindsets is an excellent way of expressing some of the key leadership attributes that are most essential in modern, agile businesses. There are, says Carol (in <span class="emphasis">Mindset: The new psychology of success</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en69" id="ch05_enx69">69</a></span>), key differences in how we view our personality.</p>
<p class="text">A ‘fixed’ mindset is founded in the view that your intelligence, character and creative ability are static and so cannot change in meaningful ways. Success is an affirmation of those inherent attributes that compare favourably to other fixed standards. Avoiding failure and striving for success become critical ways to maintain the feeling of being skilled, smart or accomplished, and so pursued at all costs. In contrast, a ‘growth’ mindset relishes challenges and sees them as an opportunity to learn, and failure as an opportunity to grow and improve.</p>
<p class="text">The context of Dweck’s research is mainly focused on children, students and how they learn but there are strong parallels to defining what successful organizational cultures and leadership should look like in the modern world. In her research, children with fixed and growth mindsets demonstrated very different approaches and goals. Those with the latter recognized the need for effort, work and practice in order to improve. Their goal was to learn at all times and at all costs. Conversely, those students with fixed mindsets were afraid to try new things in case it made them look dumb. Their goal was to look smart at all costs and to avoid tasks that might show deficiency.</p>
<p class="text">More than this, there was a key dynamic in the relationship between ability and effort. Those with fixed mindsets believed that if you have the inherent ability then you don’t need to put in the real effort. Any setbacks simply reveal their limitations and so they try to avoid deficiencies or failure at all costs, and have no way to effectively handle real difficulty. Growth mindset children, however, believe in improvement through effort and practice, and relish hard challenges as an opportunity to learn.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-164" role="doc-pagebreak" title="164"/>Dweck says that this difference is a fundamental reason behind so many students not reaching their full potential. And with the universal need for continuous improvement and more than ever for rapid and constant learning, these different mindsets and cultures are also a fundamental reason why so many organizations fail to reach their full potential. An organizational mindset that rewards leaders for looking smart and never admitting when they don’t know the answer or have made a mistake is a culture that will not support learning. A business that is too focused on outputs to the detriment of how those results will be achieved is one that will struggle to find new and potentially exceptional alternatives.</p>
<p class="text">Dweck has shown that these mindsets can be transmitted through words and actions. So in order to embed a culture of continuous learning in an organization leaders need to be very attuned to the behaviours that they support and those that they discourage. With children, Dweck has shown that praising intelligence rather than effort encourages a fixed mindset from a very early age. It can turn students off from learning. Instead, praising the process, the strategies or the effort leads to a desire to persist, to experiment and to learn at all times. We need to take the same approaches with our teams.</p>
<p class="text">Taking these themes, we might classify the key attributes of fixed and growth leadership (<a href="#ch05_tab_004">Table 5.4</a>).</p>

<p class="text-fo">As Guy Kawasaki has put it: ‘There are two kinds of people and organizations in the world: eaters and bakers. Eaters want a bigger slice of an existing pie; bakers want to make a bigger pie. Eaters think that if they win, you lose, and if you win, they lose. Bakers think that everyone can win with a bigger pie.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en70" id="ch05_enx70">70</a></span></p>
<p class="text">These behaviours are very subtle and yet the value systems that we create within organizations are hugely powerful determinants of success and failure. In the modern world we need to regard every initiative as an opportunity to learn and we need to recognize the importance of behaviours that support a growth mindset and culture.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_022">Givers and Takers</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Building on the idea of a fixed and growth leadership mindset, we can link these types of attributes to creating a high-performing culture. In his book <span class="emphasis">Give and Take: Why helping o</span><span class="emphasis">thers</span> <span class="emphasis">d</span><span class="emphasis">rives</span> <span class="emphasis">our s</span><span class="emphasis">uccess</span>,<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en71" id="ch05_enx71">71</a></span> organizational psychologist Adam Grant draws on extensive research to demonstrate that there are three basic kinds of people in the workplace, ‘Givers’, ‘Takers’ and ‘Matchers’, and that the difference between these approaches can be fundamental to our success or lack of it. Conventional wisdom has us believe that success is down to a combination of motivation, ability and opportunity, but there is a fourth, critical but often neglected, ingredient – how we choose to interact with other people: ‘Every time we interact with another person at work, we have a choice to make: do we try to claim as much value as we can, or contribute value without worrying about what we receive in return?’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en72" id="ch05_enx72">72</a></span></p>
<p class="text">According to Grant’s research, Takers are cautious, self-protective, see the world as a competitive place and so like to get more than they give. Givers, on the other hand are generous, sharing, helping others without being as concerned about reward or personal cost: ‘They tilt reciprocity in the other direction, preferring to give more than they get. Whereas takers tend to be self-focused, evaluating what other people can offer them, givers are other-focused, paying more attention to what other people need from them.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en73" id="ch05_enx73">73</a></span></p>
<p class="text">In the workplace many of us are not pure Givers and Takers, but instead what Grant calls Matchers, who operate on a principle of fairness, and strive to preserve an equal balance of giving and getting. We may adopt different <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-166" role="doc-pagebreak" title="166"/>styles according to different situations but typically each of us will develop a dominant style for social interaction and behaviour.</p>
<p class="text">When Grant looked at the degree of success that people with the different reciprocity styles had achieved he found something interesting. Givers tended to be at the bottom of the pile, but they were also right at the top of the ladder as the most successful people in the study. Takers and Matchers fell in the middle. So if Givers were both the worst and the best performers, what made the difference? It turned out that successful Givers were absolutely as ambitious as Takers or Matchers, but they made smart choices in their interactions with others. Put simply, the Givers who excel are those who are willing to ask for help when they need it.</p>
<p class="text">Moreover, when Givers do succeed, it has a cascading effect. When Takers win, there may well be someone else who loses, but when Givers win there is far more likely to be widespread support for them, creating a kind of ripple effect that enhances the success of people around them. People are envious of successful Takers. People root for successful Givers. Giver success, says Grant, creates value instead of just claiming it.</p>
<p class="text">Organizational culture has a critical influence over the dominant patterns of behaviour within a business. Cultures that recognize and support Givers create their own cascades of success that builds the foundation for exceptional performance.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch05_h3_023">Why modern leaders need to be sculptors as well as painters</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Michelangelo said this about the art of sculpture: ‘Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it. I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.’</p>
<p class="text">This quote has been used in multiple contexts. Social psychologist Eli Finkel has used it in the context of successful marriage between two people, and how a great marriage can bring out the best of what’s already inherent within both partners and enable them both to flourish.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en74" id="ch05_enx74">74</a></span> His concept of the all-or-nothing marriage describes how our expectations around marriage have changed to such an extent that a marriage that would have been acceptable to us in the 1950s would likely be a disappointment to us today, but also how the flip side of this is that with investment and work modern marriages can be more amazing than ever.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en75" id="ch05_enx75">75</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Editor and screenwriter Nils Parker uses the quote as a metaphor for the process of editing manuscripts:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-167" role="doc-pagebreak" title="167"/>Before they get to me, most manuscripts are essentially a collection of strong ideas and great stories that have been suffocated by authorial self-doubt, insecurity, and bias. My job, as the editor, is to clear all of that away and expose the greater truths that sit at the core of these stories. I shape the words around the mould created by their intent so that the ideas may come to life like they already do in the minds of their creators. The process is very much like a sculptor’s – an artist in an artisan’s body, chipping away at the rock diligently and purposefully until the image reveals itself.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en76" id="ch05_enx76">76</a></span></p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">For Michelangelo, says Parker, the idea is already there inside the hunk of stone, and the eyes and hands of the sculptor are merely vessels through which it can be brought into the physical world. Nils has also referenced Michelangelo’s thoughts on the differences between sculpture as an art form and that of painting: ‘By sculpture I mean that which is fashioned by the effort of cutting away, that which is fashioned by the method of building up being like unto painting.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch05_en77" id="ch05_enx77">77</a></span></p>
<p class="text">In building high-performing teams we too often think of a leader’s job as being like the painter. We think of our job as building and adding layers (of competency, knowledge or capability).</p>
<p class="text">Instead, we need to think about how leaders can be more like sculptors. So many things in the corporate environment can get in the way of people doing their best work – internal politics, being uncomfortable with disagreement, micromanagement. If teams are to move fast it’s so important that team members have the confidence to take ownership, and the encouragement to say what they really think.</p>
<p class="text">Stripping away the things that can get in the way of enabling people to be their true and best selves is one of the best ways in which a leader can create the culture a team needs to move rapidly and with confidence. And to enable team members to do the best work that they’ve ever done.</p>
