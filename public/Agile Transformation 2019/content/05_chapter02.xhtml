</ol><p class="text-fo">This model provides a useful vision for what good looks like in agile transformation, but as well as understanding the fundamentals of agile working and thinking, it is vitally important to acknowledge the critical mindset shifts that are involved in transitioning at scale from more traditional ways of working.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch02_h2_002"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_007">Scaling agile principles</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">The word ‘agile’ has become well worn as many businesses seek to become nimbler and more adaptive, and yet agile principles and ways of working are often poorly articulated, poorly understood and poorly applied. We might call this the ‘agile gap’ – the chasm that can often open up between a high-level, basic understanding of some agile terms and a scaled implementation of agile thinking and working that supports change, enables a sensible approach to the application of different methodologies to solve different problems, develops a broad appreciation of agile culture, and as I’ll discuss later in the book enables a good balance between actually ‘doing Agile’ and ‘being agile’.</p>
<p class="text">There are many specific methodologies that have grown up around agile (including SCRUM, SAFe, XP, Kanban) and each of these have their passionate champions, but just as there is no single roadmap for transformation, there is no one methodology that is always best. Instead, it is far more important for an organization to find its own way and develop ways of working (often through prototyping the working methodology itself) that are suited to its unique context. This process may well draw on foundational principles from Agile, Lean and design thinking in order to create a scalable approach. Alongside this it is critical to understand the fundamental mindset shifts that are involved and how we can apply these principles effectively through the organization to support transformation.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-30" role="doc-pagebreak" title="30"/>In my first book<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en2" id="ch02_enx2">2</a></span> I took a detailed look at the working methodologies, so in this book I’m going to focus on the critical principles that are the foundation, and that are often the most challenging for organizations to apply well at scale.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch02_h3_001">Design thinking</h3>
<p class="text-fo">It was David Kelley and Tim Brown, the founders of design business IDEO, who first adapted design thinking for wider business application. Tim Brown has defined design thinking as ‘a human-centred approach to innovation that draws from the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en3" id="ch02_enx3">3</a></span></p>
<p class="text">A design thinking process typically starts with empathy, seeking to understand customer or end-user needs in non-judgemental ways through observation and interviews. This is often followed by a definition phase that seeks to define the right problem to solve. Once a problem and its context has been explored, it may well be appropriate to reinterpret or redefine the problem to create a framing that will help lead to the solution. Design thinking then follows a solutions-focused approach characterized by divergent and convergent thinking, which involves originating multiple ideas and possibilities before converging around an optimal way forwards through prototyping, testing and learning.</p>
<p class="text">Design thinking is important since it is adept at working through complex problems that cannot be solved by the application of rules or technical knowledge. The critical principles that are scalable and important to take out from design thinking are:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">the value of empathy, exploration and defining the right problem to solve;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">the importance of abductive thinking, using observation and creativity to imagine possibilities and create hypotheses;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">the benefit of divergent and convergent thinking in generating many possibilities before using prototypical approaches to narrow down and learn;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">the need to iterate, and continuously learn.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">These principles are useful at scale since they support better problem definition, solutions-focused thinking, and a bringing together of human, technology and economic dynamics for business benefit.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch02_h3_002"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-31" role="doc-pagebreak" title="31"/>Agile</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Agile methodologies arose in software development in response to the challenges inherent in more traditional and rigid waterfall processes. A group of developers, meeting at the Snowbird resort in Utah in 2001 to discuss more lightweight development philosophies, published the Agile Manifesto<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en4" id="ch02_enx4">4</a></span> as a way of expressing a new way of working that captured some key shifts in value. Whilst there is value in the items on the right, they believed there to be more value in the items on the left:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">individuals and interactions over processes and tools;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">working software over comprehensive documentation;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">customer collaboration over contract negotiation;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">responding to change over following a plan.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">Agile has revolutionized the way in which technology teams worked and software is built, but smarter businesses have also come to the realization that agile principles have significant value beyond technology teams in supporting more responsive and adaptive operations right across the organization. As I go on to discuss, there are key culture and leadership contexts that are necessary to enable a scaled application of agile thinking, but there are some essential principles that underpin Agile methodologies that are more broadly applicable:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Small, multidisciplinary teams:</span> agile teams are kept small in order to adapt and move fast, and comprise the competencies needed to achieve the outputs required of the team and no more. The teams are often self-organizing, co-located and characterized by a high level of autonomy.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Sprint working:</span> the team works iteratively in blocks of time or sprints (usually one to four weeks) against an agreed set of priorities. The sprints follow the same fundamental pattern, beginning with a prioritization of the backlog and a sprint planning process to identify the highest priority items that will be taken into the sprint. The majority of the sprint is focused on doing the work to achieve the required outputs and using techniques like daily standups to help remove blockers to moving quickly. At the end of the sprint, a review captures what was achieved and a retrospective enables learning about ways of working that can empower continuous improvement.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Backlogs, epics and user stories:</span> rather than specify rigid, up-front requirements following a lengthy period of capturing requirements, teams break down large challenges/problems/projects into smaller components, <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-32" role="doc-pagebreak" title="32"/>which are then prioritized in a backlog. An epic can be thought of as a large body of work, often with one focused objective, that can be broken down into a number of smaller stories. Each user story is a high-level definition of a requirement, and might be expressed in these terms: ‘As a (role) I want (goal) so that (benefit)’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en5" id="ch02_enx5">5</a></span> User stories can be used to express requirements working back from the customer or end-user, and usually contain just enough information to enable an estimate of the effort needed to fulfil it.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Adaptation and iteration:</span> since the backlog is reprioritized at the start of every sprint, allowing requirements to change over time, and keeping the team focused on realizing maximum value (wherever possible customer value) as early as possible, sprint working naturally embeds adaptation into the fabric of the way in which teams are working. Teams require the flexibility and autonomy (usually working with a product owner who oversees the product backlog) to flex and adapt as they go.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Velocity:</span> agile teams predict and track their velocity through effort estimates relating to user stories. This means that they can more accurately predict how long a project will take to complete and avoid planning fallacy, the concept first described by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, which shows that we are inherently overoptimistic when predicting how much time is needed to complete a future task, which results in underestimation of time and effort.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en6" id="ch02_enx6">6</a></span> Teams track their velocity and progress in transparent ways, often using physical displays near the team.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Retrospective:</span> a good retrospective is an opportunity to focus on improving ways of operating. Questions addressed in a typical retrospective might focus on what to stop doing, what to start doing, what to continue, what to do more or less of. The ‘after action review’ from the US military is an example, simple framework for retrospective that aligns the team around agreed facts (What was supposed to happen? What actually happened?) and shared opinions (Why was there a difference? What can we learn from this?). Retrospectives are useful since they embed continuous learning and improvement into the fabric of how teams work.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Definition of done and the sprint demo:</span> the ‘definition of done’ in an agile team is a consistent, agreed set of criteria that outputs have to fulfil in order to be counted as ‘done’. This is useful in supporting high quality of outputs, consistency and continuous governance of outputs. In a sprint demo, working outputs are demonstrated to stakeholders in order to <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-33" role="doc-pagebreak" title="33"/>solicit feedback that can be incorporated into future work and sprints. The demo can therefore be very useful in keeping stakeholders updated on progress and running an inclusive development process.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Product owners and scrum masters:</span> the product owner plays a key role in owning the vision for the end product and also representing the voice of the customer and also key stakeholders in the business. Scrum masters facilitate interaction on the team to ensure good communication and alignment, help remove barriers to moving quickly, ensure the team is sticking to agile values, and protecting the team from outside interference or distraction. Both are key roles but neither is there to directly tell the team what to do – the team decides the best way to solve the challenges set (<a href="#ch02_fig_001">Figure 2.1</a>).</p></li>

</figure>
<p class="text-fo">These are principles and practices that have grown up around Agile but have much broader application and benefit:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">the ability to embed continuous learning, adaptation and responsiveness into everyday operations;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">the approaches to prioritization around a more balanced understanding of customer and business needs;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-34" role="doc-pagebreak" title="34"/>the understanding of the ability of small teams to create disproportionate value;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">the inclusive approach to development to help support ongoing buy-in and mitigate surprises and distraction;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">the recognition of the benefits of accurately predicting time and effort and tracking velocity and progress;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">the appreciation of team autonomy and the role of leadership in removing barriers to moving fast.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="text-fo">All of these practices are now fundamental to how organizations need to operate in complex adaptive environments.</p>
<p class="text">Agile is no silver bullet, and it is essential to take an intelligent approach to how we apply different thinking and value creation techniques across a business. But, as I discuss later, agile working and thinking have the potential to transform large, slow organizations to become far more responsive, yet they involve some fundamental mindset shifts that challenge entrenched belief systems and habits that have grown up over decades in companies. This is no small shift, and organizations that underestimate the significance of this change or under-commit to both doing Agile and being agile, will fail to truly adapt for the modern world.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch02_h3_003">Lean Startup</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Building on the practices that have long been a key part of Lean manufacturing and philosophies like the Toyota Production System (TPS), Lean Startup set out a product development methodology which, in keeping with Agile, is about starting small and scaling fast. Fundamental to Lean manufacturing and TPS was the idea that anything in a process that sits outside of the creation of value for the end-customer is potentially wastage that can be systematically removed. The process sought to bring in inputs only at the point they were needed (hence ‘just in time’ production), minimize correction time by eliminating imperfections in output as early as possible, and focus on ‘Kaizen’ or continuous improvement.</p>
<p class="text">Similarly, the principles of Lean Startup, expounded in Eric Ries’ book of the same name,<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en7" id="ch02_enx7">7</a></span> are about eliminating unnecessary waste, continuous improvement through learning, iterative product development and fast customer feedback loops. Like scientific method it seeks to test hypotheses about customer needs through prototyping, removing assumptions and turning them into validated learning. Like Agile, Lean Startup is as much <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-35" role="doc-pagebreak" title="35"/>about the mindset as it is about the process and it involves some fundamental principles that have much broader application than product development:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">The build–measure–learn loop:</span> like Agile, Lean Startup uses an iterative cycle that seeks to identify a hypothesis (all customer needs or solutions or product features are hypotheses until tested), design a test or prototype (wherever possible to be directed at real end-users, developing validated learnings that can then inform the next hypothesis and learning loop. This process is useful in identifying what Eric Ries calls ‘leap of faith’ assumptions – all the things that need to be true in order for an outcome to happen – and testing them one by one to create validated learnings. The process therefore mitigates risk through learning, adaptation and eliminating uncertainty.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">The minimum viable product (MVP):</span> the MVP has become another piece of jargon that is often misunderstood or misapplied. Eric Ries described this as the ‘<span class="emphasis">version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort</span>’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en8" id="ch02_enx8">8</a></span> The principle is to start small with simple tests and prototypes in order for you to learn fast and scale by moving through successive learning loops quickly. As I’ll discuss later, there can be some significant mindset and cultural challenges around starting small in organizations that are used to big up-front investments.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Innovation accounting:</span> traditional accounting and budgeting methods work well with established propositions and in stable environments but can be problematic when an organization needs to innovate at scale and move quickly with fluidity. A focus on short-term payback and metrics governed by ratios and cash flow analysis for example can act to stifle innovation. Overly rigid budgeting and forecasting processes can hamper adaptiveness. Lean Startup’s focus on actionable rather than vanity metrics (that is, measures that better represent customer interaction, performance and business drivers) enables a more sophisticated approach to understanding project trajectory and budget prioritization. Dave McClure’s ‘Pirate Metrics’ framework, for example, sets out a hierarchy of measures around Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Referral and Revenue (AARRR – hence Pirate Metrics) that flows from customer usage to growth to financial measures in a way that enables a better appreciation of the potential of early-stage ideas to deliver value. Innovation accounting therefore involves finance teams acting more like venture capitalists in releasing successive rounds of funding for projects <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-36" role="doc-pagebreak" title="36"/>based on measures and trajectory.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en9" id="ch02_enx9">9</a></span> Small teams should be enabled to spend small amounts of money to demonstrate how they can progress value and reduce risk of scalability.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">The pivot:</span> another overused but poorly understood term, the pivot is described by Ries as a ‘<span class="emphasis">structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth</span>’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en10" id="ch02_enx10">10</a></span> Pivots keep one foot in maintaining the guiding vision for the product or project whilst still enabling a refocus of proposition or key features. Pivots can be challenging to execute in environments that don’t support adaptation and change, and there are not insignificant mindset challenges around avoiding well-known biases that may lead to poor decision-making. The ability to make smart choices about whether to continue, stop or pivot in an initiative is an increasingly valuable yet underrated leadership skill.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">Lean Startup is structured around continuous involvement of customers and so, like Agile, works back from the end-user, defines value in customer-centric ways, and enables businesses to stay closer to changing contexts. Yet it also speaks to more fundamental practices that support breadth as well as depth of innovation, the mitigation of risk, and learning fast at scale. Like Agile, a poor or half-hearted implementation of Lean Startup can easily lead to poor decision-making, under-realized value, and a drift back to more traditional linear ways of working and thinking.</p>
<p class="text">Design thinking, Agile and Lean Startup (and the many variant processes that they have spawned) all offer related practices that enable far greater flexibility and adaptiveness for a complex, changing, non-linear world. But the value inherent in the mindset, culture and approaches that they all speak to applies way beyond product development, design and technology teams.</p>
<p class="text">Given how fundamental this way of thinking can be to supporting transformation, let’s consider some of the key mindset challenges involved with a broad shift towards agile culture and working.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch02_h2_003"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_008">The key shifts from linear thinking</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">The transformation from traditional linear thinking, exemplified by waterfall project management, to more iterative, agile ways of operating involves some critical mental and operational leaps that can mean the difference between success and failure in agile transformation. If we are to become <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-37" role="doc-pagebreak" title="37"/>more agile as an organization, then a wider appreciation and application of these core ways of thinking is critical to success. This is about recognizing that agile principles are more than just a process and working methodology to be used in technology teams. Applied correctly and judiciously it is a way of operating and thinking that equips organizations to become more responsive and manoeuvrable in complex adaptive environments.</p>
<p class="text">The processes themselves can teach us about these wider mindset shifts and can also act as a catalyst for embedding new approaches and positive habits. Take, for example, a service design process. Here’s an example, drawn from the public sector, of the sequential flow that characterizes Waterfall methodologies:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">Gather requirements and inputs.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Agree a plan.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Pick a supplier and set goals.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Plan the project.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Start implementation.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Finish implementation.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Handover and evaluation.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en11" id="ch02_enx11">11</a></span></p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo">Waterfall methodologies grew up in the manufacturing and construction industries in highly structured environments where design changes in the development process would quickly become prohibitively expensive. So the design needed to be defined at the start in great detail and then remain relatively unchanged through the manufacturing or construction process. It is therefore a process methodology that is specifically designed to mitigate change and adaptation. We take all our inputs at the start and finish that process before moving to the next stage and designing the solution to those requirements, which we would also do in great detail. We would complete the design or the plan before moving towards implementation or build. The design or the plan remains relatively unchanged and we build to those exact specifications. Once this stage is complete, we move to test or verify, and then launch to the end-users or customers.</p>
<p class="text">Waterfall thinking and processes work well in stable, slow-moving environments where plans need to be fixed, development approaches more rigidly structured, and the environment and conditions are largely unchanging and widely understood. Their linear nature means that they are relatively simple to follow and to understand. So perhaps inevitably, these kinds of approaches <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-38" role="doc-pagebreak" title="38"/>have become embedded not just in technology development, but much more broadly in business process, thinking and strategy. Business decision-making and business cases, for example, often follow this one-size-fits-all approach of gathering comprehensive inputs, creating a detailed plan and forecasts, big investment and a lengthy programme of implementation that deviates little from the plan. In the fast-moving, complex environments in which we now conduct much of our business this opens up a number of significant vulnerabilities to those operating in this way. Key to these are the compounding, interrelated challenges of time, complexity and adaptability:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Adaptability:</span> contexts, customer needs, requirements, competitive challenges are all changing much faster, and linear process thinking is poor at capturing and responding to change. This often means that solutions are shipped at the end of a process that are no longer fit for purpose, or that require immediate changes to be made. Requirements gathering processes can not only be lengthy, but can also fail to capture real user need since people often don’t know what they really want. Problem definition needs to be a continual process, and the response to evolving problems requires flexibility and adaptation.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Complexity:</span> since an increasing degree of business focus is about operating in relatively unknown environments or uncharted territory (either because of the growing complexity of markets and technological change, or rapidly shifting competitive situations, or the need to innovate and grow into new and less familiar territory) there is a heightened need for experimentation, testing and rapid learning. Waterfall thinking does not lend itself well to any of these. Complex scenarios also require concurrent, multidisciplinary problem solving and collaboration, and cognitive diversity, which traditional linear processes do not support well.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span class="strong">Time:</span> detail-driven, sequential processes may work well for the construction industry, but may well be lengthy developments and are not suited to situations in which speed-to-market is key, or advantage resides in solving customer problems better, easier, faster. Unforeseen problems that crop up in development and that inevitably were not captured in requirements gathering can further delay timing.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">Complex, rapidly changing environments with high levels of uncertainty require a different response and different thinking. They require us to begin with the users, to work out what they need, to test solutions and then be ready to flex and change as contexts and requirements change. We still have <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-39" role="doc-pagebreak" title="39"/>a vision and a direction for where we are going and what we want to achieve, but we iterate in an informed way and stay closer to changing needs and contexts as we go:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number">Meet the users.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Understand the users’ needs.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Build a prototype.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Get feedback from real users.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number">Iterate, with constant feedback.</p></li>

</ol><p class="text-fo">Flexibility, adaptability and continuous learning are built into these processes. They are inherent to the fabric of this whole way of thinking.</p>
<p class="text">The big opportunity here, as this book sets out, is to take agile, iterative principles and culture and to scale this way of operating and thinking to help entire businesses transform to become more agile and responsive to a very different world: to develop a far more informed and nuanced view of where in the business it is right to stick with traditional, linear approaches to value creation, and where it is right to implement more iterative ways of operating. But also to BE more agile as a business and adopt the kind of thinking and culture that can enable more flexible, adaptive processes and working to scale and to thrive.</p>
<p class="text">In order to do that well we need to fully appreciate the key mindset shifts involved in the adoption of more agile approaches, most notably in relation to value creation, risk and visibility. These conventions are applicable to working methodologies and projects but beyond this capture the wider strategic differences, mindset changes, and fundamental assumptions that are at play when an organization wants to become more agile. These shifts represent not only opportunities to manage these dynamics differently, but also potential cultural and attitudinal barriers that can prevent agile transformation from being successful.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch02_h3_004">Value creation</h3>
<p class="text-fo">As we mentioned before, embedded ways of creating value, making decisions and business cases in businesses are strongly Waterfall focused. It’s all about gathering comprehensive inputs, setting out detailed plans, and quality of <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-40" role="doc-pagebreak" title="40"/>execution against those fixed plans. Somehow, we feel more comfortable with a PowerPoint presentation or a spreadsheet that sets out a linear progression for the initiative with set stage gates and forecast outcomes at every stage, even when those forecasts are based on contexts that are highly likely to change, or projections extrapolated from past data that are already out of date. It’s false certainty, and simply creates more work in justifying why you’ve moved away from those forecasts as the project progresses.</p>
<p class="text">Far better surely to acknowledge when contexts are likely to shift, to set a directional course and a vision for the project outcome, but then be more fluid and adaptive in how you achieve that vision. Tracking progress towards a goal is important, but we need to be more adaptive than a linear set of rigid targets set out at the start allows for and instead be smarter about how we fund projects and track leading indicators.</p>
<p class="text">One of the key mindset shifts involved here is around value creation. In any initiative or project, we often imagine value creation to be roughly proportionate to the effort that we put in, and to progress in a reasonably linear fashion with value being created steadily as we go. In reality, of course, if we frame this as both customer and business value, waterfall approaches have a rapid delivery of value at the end of the process. We do a whole bunch of work speaking to stakeholders, designing and building, where the business or customer sees very little value before launching the proposition at the end. If we do agile correctly we do the complete opposite; we concentrate on delivering as much value as early on in the process as possible, and then iterating from there to continually deliver more value. The business and the customer are able to benefit far earlier. We might represent these differences as in <a href="#ch02_fig_002">Figure 2.2</a>.</p>

<p class="text-fo"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-41" role="doc-pagebreak" title="41"/>If we were to substitute time on the <span class="emphasis">x</span>-axis with effort, the same will often be true. We’re focused always on how we can deliver maximum value as early as possible, particularly to customers (because if customers are happy the business is usually happy, right?) but also to the business.</p>
<p class="text">This conceptual change requires a mental leap that if not achieved, can become a cultural and behavioural barrier to change. There is comfort in detailed plans, so we need to reappraise our understanding of the level of inputs that we need up front and be more comfortable with learning along the way. There is comfort in rigid, linear time-planning and stage-gate review processes so we need to be more comfortable with not knowing in advance exactly where we will be at any given stage in the project (but then we never really knew anyway). And there is comfort in spending huge amounts of time and resource building a highly sophisticated solution that we’re all excited about before launching it to market, so we need to get better at ‘fast and roughly right’ combined with proper agile governance.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch02_h3_005">Adaptability</h3>
<p class="text-fo">Another key mindset shift is around the flexibility that we need to adapt easily, judiciously and rapidly. In a business world characterized by linear thinking, change and flex become hard to do. We might conceptually believe that we are maintaining a consistent level in the potential to change through a project, but the reality is often different. In a Waterfall-dominated environment the more we progress through a project the more time and resource we spend on it and the more invested we become in a particular course of action that we believe will determine success. The recognition and support of our superiors depends on it. We become path dependent, and increasingly less likely to make significant changes the further we go on. With more iterative approaches, however, the ability to flex, learn and adapt is built in to the process and so whilst we may lose some degree of flex as we go on, it is far less than in a linear model. We might represent these differences in <a href="#ch02_fig_003">Figure 2.3</a>.</p>
<figure aria-describedby="ch02_fig_003_details" class="figure" id="ch02_fig_003"><figcaption><p class="figure"><span class="label" epub:type="label"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-42" role="doc-pagebreak" title="42"/>Figure</span> <span class="ordinal" epub:type="ordinal">2.3</span> Agile vs Waterfall adaptability</p></figcaption><p class="figure-media"><img alt="A comparison graph shows agile versus waterfall adaptability.

<p class="text-fo">At a broader level within business, this problem can mean that it is very easy for businesses to become path dependent on particular strategies and versions of what success looks like. It can dramatically reduce manoeuvrability and result in the business becoming stuck.</p>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch02_h3_006">Approaches to risk</h3>
<p class="text-fo">In his book on rethinking risk management (<span class="emphasis">Rethinki</span><span class="emphasis">ng Risk Management: Critically examining old ideas and new c</span><span class="emphasis">oncepts</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en13" id="ch02_enx13">13</a></span>) Rick Nason, Associate Professor at Rowe School of Business, makes the case for why we need to redefine how we manage risk in organizations. Traditional approaches, he argues, see risk management teams as the ‘department of no’, overly reliant on third-party frameworks, and lacking in independent thinking: ‘Very quickly, frameworks tend to become risk management, rather than a guide for risk management. In other words, people manage to the framework, rather than manage risk – two very different things.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en14" id="ch02_enx14">14</a></span></p>
<p class="text">A more balanced approach takes into account upside or good risk whilst also mitigating the impact and probability from bad risk. It is, Nason says, a balance between art and science, process and judgement. This positions risk management much more as a strategic contributor to value creation. Problem definition, and understanding whether an issue is simple, complicated or complex, is the first step in developing that strategic understanding. I’ll talk later in the book about how this approach to problem definition can support more sophisticated thinking around the methodologies that we use to solve challenges, and where we do Agile and where we don’t. But in managing risk it is helpful to have an appreciation that simple and complicated challenges can largely be solved by rules and processes whereas solving complex issues requires judgement but also a ‘manage, not solve’ approach that involves trying, learning and adaptation, where it is less important to define the exact solution at the start than it is to take a broad, creative <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-43" role="doc-pagebreak" title="43"/>approach to how you might find the right solution. Structured approaches to managing risk in simple and complicated domains make sense, but in complex areas we need structure to get out of the way so that a flexible, emergent approach to risk management is possible.</p>
<p class="text">The risk culture that an organization carries with it can be a significant barrier or enabler to change. If the culture is set up in a way that people are fearful that there will always be blame and consequence for risk outcomes, they are more likely to hide events from risk management that can amplify rather than mitigate risk. Risk homeostasis, or risk compensation, was developed as a theory by Gerald JS Wilde, a professor of psychology at Queen’s University, Ontario, Canada, and it posits that everyone has an acceptable level of risk that they like to operate to. People may well adjust their behaviour in response to a perceived level of risk in a situation in order to come more in line with that acceptable risk level. So they may become more careful where they believe a greater amount of risk exists but conversely they may also take more (perhaps unnecessary) risks in situations that are heavily locked down by risk management.</p>
<p class="text">When in 1967 Sweden changed from driving on the left to driving on the right, the next 18 months saw a marked reduction in traffic fatalities that Wilde hypothesized this was due to drivers responding to increased danger by taking more care. In a well-known 1994 traffic study in Munich, a group of taxi drivers were given cabs that were equipped with anti-lock brakes (ABS) and a control group were given cabs that were identical in every way except that they didn’t have ABS. When the results were analysed by Wilde, they showed that a very similar number of accidents happened in each group, leading him to conclude that those drivers who had been given the extra safety features then drove more aggressively, so maintaining a similar accident rate.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en15" id="ch02_enx15">15</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Risk-averse culture can easily generate more unintended risk. When in 2013 the Obama administration launched Healthcare.gov, the online insurance market for US citizens to access affordable health insurance, the system immediately crashed when it went live and it took weeks to get it working properly. Citizens couldn’t even log in to what was meant to be a one-stop hub for insurance that had cost more than US $400 million to build.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en16" id="ch02_enx16">16</a></span></p>
<p class="text">A whole series of managerial, technical and financial errors contributed to the site collapsing at launch, but author Clay Shirky wrote an analysis at the time that highlighted how the culture in the team that worked on the system made it very hard to pass bad news back up the line and the environment was one in which failure was not an option. Shirky noted how sticking <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-44" role="doc-pagebreak" title="44"/>to rigid waterfall-type processes had mitigated the ability to learn from tests, to adapt as necessary and so had built up huge risk over time:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote">An effective test is an exercise in humility; it’s only useful in a culture where desirability is not confused with likelihood. For a test to change things, everyone has to understand that their opinion, and their boss’s opinion, matters less than what actually works and what doesn’t.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en17" id="ch02_enx17">17</a></span></p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">The result was a bloated site that reportedly had 500 million lines of code, a giant house of cards, and a disastrous launch. Rather than avoiding failure, the lack of early and aggressive testing simply stored it up. Rather than taking smaller, acceptable risks in public early on, they accumulated risk. It was not simply a procurement problem; it was a management and a cultural problem.</p>
<p class="text">Many large organizations are hampered by risk-averse cultures that prevent them from experimenting widely and frequently. An organization needs to be very focused in where it chooses to place its bets, but then it needs to test solutions, learn and scale rapidly in order to identify where the real opportunity is. That means a systematic allocation of resource towards testing hypotheses and iterating value, and the fluidity and flexibility to recognize when a given path is no longer valid and to shift focus and resources. The reality, of course, is that the more experimentation you do, the more you learn, the more you innovate, the less risk there is of your future being decided for you. A focus on learning rather than avoiding risk at all costs creates a more resilient organization.</p>
<p class="text">Similarly, a culture of openness and transparency can encourage managers to take prudent risks within understood parameters of risk tolerance, which results in more progress, creativity and motivation. Establishing clear ‘safe to fail’ parameters means that you’re not betting the company through risky experimentation but instead setting people free to test and learn within an environment that rewards them to do this whilst mitigating unnecessary risk.</p>
<p class="text">When moving to more agile ways of working this can involve a challenging mindset shift in the relation between risk and reward. In a Waterfall world we’re used to taking all of our inputs at the beginning of the process, making a decision and betting big by investing heavily in a limited number of ways to realize the value we believe there is to be had. In a complex adaptive world, however, it is more appropriate to have a clear view on what the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-45" role="doc-pagebreak" title="45"/>future looks like, to be decisive about your direction, but then to start small and learn and scale fast. This requires multiple small bets, rapid learning, quick scaling and/or disengagement and an appreciation that rather than betting big on two initiatives in the hope that one will succeed, we’re placing ten smaller bets but out of those ten perhaps nine will fail and one will pay back really big.</p>
<p class="text">In a Waterfall world, since investment comes up front and value creation and customer feedback come towards the end of the process, the risk largely stays with us until the end. In Agile, we seek to mitigate risk as early as possible by learning as we go, ensuring that we’re not investing resource, time and money unnecessarily on things that the customer doesn’t actually want. We might represent the differences as in <a href="#ch02_fig_004">Figure 2.4</a>.</p>

<p class="text-fo">One of the key principles of iterative processes such as Lean and Agile is that we are listing our leap-of-faith assumptions as a backlog and then looking to test them one by one to turn them into validated learnings. In rigid, linear processes it’s easy to bake-in untested assumptions right at the beginning of the process and then only find out that it is an incorrect assumption at an advanced stage of development, perhaps even when we put the finished product live to end-users. This creates heightened risk and vulnerability, particularly when things around you are changing fast. With linear processes the cost of change goes up as you progress. With iterative processes you are deliberately reducing risk as you go.</p>

<span class="emphasis">Airbus A380</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="text-fo">Later in the book we’ll discuss the importance of aligned autonomy as a way to empower moving fast whilst still retaining strong directional alignment and governance. One story of what happened in the development process of the new Airbus A380, the world’s largest commercial airliner, is a stark reminder of what can happen in the absence of proper alignment, but also how significant assumptions that are baked-in to a development process can be.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en18" id="ch02_enx18">18</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The essence of the story focuses on how different design groups working in different countries on the project had used different versions of the same Computer Aided Design (CAD) software. As the engineering drawings were being developed across multiple teams, German and Spanish designers were using version 4 of the CATIA software, whilst British and French teams had upgraded to version 5. The trouble with this was that version 5 of the software was a significant upgrade from the previous version, meaning that there were notable inconsistencies that emerged only as the first aircraft prototype was being built in Toulouse.</p>
<p class="text">Despite being manufactured to specification, as the 530 kilometres of wiring and cables began to be woven into the airframe, engineers quickly noticed that many of the wires were a few centimetres too short. The complexity of the wiring system (more than 100,000 wires) coupled with the discrepancies between the software meant that the redesign, rebuild and consequent multiple project delays (at one point more than 1,100 German engineers were camped out at the Toulouse production facility trying to rectify the problems<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en19" id="ch02_enx19">19</a></span>) resulted in months of delays and a huge overspend.</p>
<p class="text">The situation was exacerbated by a complex organizational structure that originated from the history of the Airbus business as a consortium of separate companies. Not creating a single project team across different centres, ongoing pressure to keep the project moving forwards to fulfil an overly aggressive schedule, and misdirected emphasis on keeping different parts of the company happy rather than focusing on what was best for the aircraft also hindered the development. Delays in the A380 development project cost the business a reported US $6.1 billion.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en20" id="ch02_enx20">20</a></span> It’s a clear example of the potential cost of not testing assumptions and adding unnecessary complexity to an important project.</p>
</section>
<h3 class="head-b" id="ch02_h3_007">Approaches to visibility</h3>
<p class="text-fo">It can be easy to believe with waterfall approaches that since we’re building in regular stage gates we have good visibility of progress throughout the initiative, yet the reality can be very different. As the project progresses through stages that involve intensive and detailed work by individual teams or functions it can easily happen that we lose visibility on exactly what is happening with progress and, as I’ve already mentioned, even to have a significant assumption baked-in to the development without realizing it. With iterative approaches it might be difficult to predict with certainty at the start of a project where we will be at a given stage (if you do, you’re not being agile), but with proper agile governance we can actually maintain a good level of clarity throughout. We might represent the key differences as in <a href="#ch02_fig_005">Figure 2.5</a>.</p>

<p class="text-fo">The key point here is that these are all key mindset shifts that if not addressed can become significant barriers to the adoption of new ways of thinking and cause us to drift back to more comfortable, linear practices. As we seek to not only use iterative methodologies more widely through the business but to adopt agile mindsets throughout, these differences become critical representations of success and failure.</p>

<h2 class="head-a" id="ch02_h2_005"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-49" role="doc-pagebreak" title="49"/><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_010">The impact of rising customer expectation</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Customer experience has become THE area of focus over the past few years for organizations from the broadest spread of sectors. As more products become services, and even physical goods are augmented with layers of software-driven service interaction, the operational focus of many organizations is shifting from a focus on value chain efficiency to ecosystems of value where customer experience becomes a critical component.</p>
<p class="text">There can be little doubt about just how important customer experience is to business value creation. A survey by Defaqto Research found that 55 per cent of consumers would pay more for a better customer experience.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en21" id="ch02_enx21">21</a></span> A report by Walker Group predicted that by 2020 customer experience will overtake price and product as the key brand differentiator.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en22" id="ch02_enx22">22</a></span> Respondents to Econsultancy’s annual Digital Trends Report<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en23" id="ch02_enx23">23</a></span> (published in association with Adobe and based on a global survey of more than 14,000 digital professionals) named ‘optimizing customer experience’ as the most exciting business opportunity for the coming year. The same answer has been top of the list for the last four iterations of this research, demonstrating that this is a long-term, but game-changing priority.</p>
<p class="text">So it is for future potential advantage. When asked what are anticipated to be the primary ways in which their organization (or their client’s organization in the case of agency respondents) will differentiate themselves over the next five years from competitors, participants in the same Econsultancy survey named customer experience as the primary focus.</p>
<p class="text">There are evidently many challenges wrapped up in this focus on delivering exceptional customer experience, not least those inherent in joining up disparate data sources and effectively extracting insight and value through application, the challenge of legacy systems, and the reinvention of the business itself (structures, processes, priorities) to be more responsive to rapidly shifting consumer and competitive contexts.</p>
<p class="text">This is an ongoing challenge, not least because for every slick new service that comes to market, customer expectation rises with it. Author Adam Morgan once described this phenomenon as ‘Uber’s children’ – the idea that this ongoing rise in customer expectation creates a continually shifting context that businesses need to deliver to and the need for continuous (not episodic) improvement.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en24" id="ch02_enx24">24</a></span></p>
<p class="text">In 2015, the Uber Data Team did an analysis on whether increased efficiency (shorter time to get a cab) resulted in increased expectations over time from Uber users. They found that the cities that Uber had been in longest had <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-50" role="doc-pagebreak" title="50"/>experienced the sharpest decay in the willingness to wait for a car.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en25" id="ch02_enx25">25</a></span> The greater the efficiencies Uber gained from improvements in supply and optimizing despatch algorithms, the more impatient people became in their expectation – a pattern that was replicated regardless of geography. As the Uber team said: ‘The bottom line is that we realize we have to continually raise the bar, to get you home from the bar.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en26" id="ch02_enx26">26</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The bottom line for just about every business is that as customer experience increasingly becomes the differentiator, the agility to respond to shifting user expectation becomes one of the key competitive advantages or disadvantages. This is no small change. It means a reorientation of the entire business towards far more customer-centric structures, processes, practices and behaviours.</p>
<p class="text">Yet somehow despite the obvious importance of customer experience in driving business value, and the fact that just about every business professes to be customer-centric, so much of the reality of consumer experience is anything but customer-centric. Still now, years after the importance of customer experience as a differentiator and profit driver became evident, we have a myriad of examples of businesses doing things for distinctly company-centric rather than customer-centric reasons. So we have contact numbers buried in websites behind FAQs because it’s more convenient for companies not to have to pay someone to answer customer questions. We have poorly implemented automation that fails to give customers what they want when they need it, that pushes customers through automated menus rather than just being able to ask a person a question, or worse bombards them with unnecessary and wasteful messages when they don’t want or need it. We have complicated log-in and security procedures that have failed to keep up with new technology, and unnecessarily complex customer journeys that are not joined up, awkward to navigate and anything but customer-centric.</p>
<p class="text">In spite of all the promise we have ended up in an age of multiple inboxes, payment and identity systems that are far from seamless, competing ecosystems that don’t talk to each other, and creaking back-end infrastructure that leaks data or crashes services.</p>
<p class="text">Tom Goodwin (author of <span class="emphasis">Digital Darwinism: Survival of the</span> <span class="emphasis">f</span><span class="emphasis">ittest in the</span> <span class="emphasis">a</span><span class="emphasis">ge of</span> <span class="emphasis">b</span><span class="emphasis">usiness</span> <span class="emphasis">d</span><span class="emphasis">isruption</span><span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en27" id="ch02_enx27">27</a></span>) has described this as the ‘mid-digital age’ – an age of peak complexity when we have all the possibilities of new technologies but are still burdened with the thinking of the past, resulting in too much complexity, poor interoperability and clunky customer experience.</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-51" role="doc-pagebreak" title="51"/>This energy – the disruptive forces, the vast feeling of change, the acceleration of complexity, the stress of companies fighting for the profit margins of the past – is where we now lie. The complexity is found in every aspect of our lives and we tend not to notice it because we’re enamoured by the wonder of the new.</p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">As customer expectation continually rises, businesses of all types need to always be adapting, evolving and transforming in response. This is not about periodic investments and innovation; it is about rapid customer feedback loops that enable continuous iteration and new thinking.</p>

<span class="emphasis">How the music industry became its own worst enemy</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="text-fo">Sometimes entire industries can implement strategies that make no sense for the customer and can create strategic vulnerability. In the 1990s, the record industry made specific efforts to try to kill retail sales of the single in favour of the more lucrative album format. The result was a salutary lesson for businesses of all types.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en28" id="ch02_enx28">28</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The album had, of course, been the prominent format from the 1960s, with singles frequently seen as a way of boosting sales of the accompanying long-player, particularly in the 1980s when albums like <span class="emphasis">Thriller</span>, <span class="emphasis">Hysteria</span> and <span class="emphasis">Born in the USA</span> all put out a high proportion of tracks as singles (<span class="emphasis">Thriller</span>, for example, had seven out of nine tracks released).</p>
<p class="text">In the 1990s, however, record companies (starting with Capitol Records and MC Hammer believe it or not) went to war on the retail single by promoting hits to radio that you could buy only on a full-length album (think Alanis Morissette) giving rise to the phenomenon in the late 1990s of consumers being forced to shell out for an entire album that likely had one good song on it (think Chumbawamba). The reason for this was, of course, that the labels could make more money that way, but inevitably they generated resentment amongst their customers, which would eventually come back and bite them in a big way. The story of how Napster disrupted the music business in the run-up to the turn of the century is well documented, but it also provides a lens through which to see how the industry’s own practices had set it up for a spectacular fall.</p>
<p class="text">It’s a great example of how easy it is for entire industries to misalign incentives and goals and pursue strategies that might make sense on the balance sheet in the short term but make no sense in the long term and build up the kind of fragility that makes them highly vulnerable to genuinely far-reaching disruption.</p>

<h2 class="head-a" id="ch02_h2_006"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-52" role="doc-pagebreak" title="52"/><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_011">The ‘platformization’ of capability</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">The word ‘platform’ is perhaps a little overused these days, but it speaks to perhaps one of the most significant transitions inherent to business economics in the digital age. The internet has always been great at facilitating relationships between nodes in a network, but the shift from traditional ‘pipeline’ businesses to so-called ‘platform’ organizations capitalizes on this in a way that neatly characterizes truly digital-native thinking and models.</p>
<p class="text">A good exploration of this concept comes from Van Alstyne, Parker and Choudary in their article that talks about the new rules for strategy in which they make the point that platforms are not entirely new – like many things, the digital age simply serves to give certain concepts a heightened importance, or a brand-new context or application.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en29" id="ch02_enx29">29</a></span> Yet the internet era has changed some key dynamics: the need to own infrastructure and assets; scalability becoming faster and cheaper; interaction and participation more frictionless; the flow and exchange of data and value more fluid. These new dynamics have enabled a new type of business to take shape: ‘Platform businesses bring together producers and consumers in high-value exchanges. Their chief assets are information and interactions, which together are also the source of the value they create and their competitive advantage.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en30" id="ch02_enx30">30</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The classic value chain model that we discussed earlier (originated by Michael Porter, of course) fits the linear idea of ‘pipeline’ businesses, where inputs go in at one end, go through a series of processes and activities in the organization to result in outputs, and the margin is the difference between the resultant value that is created and the cost of creating that value. In contrast, platform businesses sit within an ecosystem that typically comprises four key components:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">owners of the platform;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">providers who serve as the platform’s interface;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">producers who create their offerings;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">consumers who use those offerings.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">As an example, Google owns the Android platform, but partners with mobile device manufacturers (the providers), third-party app developers (the producers), and consumers (who utilize the platform but also return value in the form of usage data and revenue). It’s perfectly possible for companies to be both a pipeline and a platform business (as indeed Google and Apple are with their device manufacturing business, and app store <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-53" role="doc-pagebreak" title="53"/>marketplace and services business) but the difference between the two involves a few key strategic and mindset shifts, which Van Alstyne, Parker and Choudary capture as:</p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">From resource control to resource orchestration:</span> instead of a model strongly focused on ownership and control of (perhaps scarce or unique) resources (which may be tangible or intangible, like IP), the main value asset (and what is difficult to copy) comes from the community, assets and contributions of the producers and consumers.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">From internal optimization to external interaction:</span> rather than a (internal) primary focus on efficiency in value chain activities, the value in platform businesses comes from facilitating the (external) interaction between producers and consumers. As the authors note, this means a focus on ecosystem governance rather than costs of production.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">From a focus on customer value to a focus on ecosystem value:</span> the difference here is that between optimizing lifetime customer value and the value that comes from optimizing an expanding ecosystem powered by iterative, fast-feedback loops (the example they give is perhaps subsidizing one type of consumer in order to attract another type).</p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo">Key to platform business thinking then, are concepts like network effects – the principle that the more participants there are in the system the better and more attractive the system becomes (better supply–demand matching, more data to apply), driving scalability, demand-side economies of scale, and advantages in average value per transaction. Network effects create the kind of virtuous feedback loop that has enabled companies like Alibaba to scale in the way that they have.</p>
<p class="text">This is very different from linear ‘pipeline’ businesses that are focused on avoiding traditional threats (like those expressed in Porter’s ‘Five Forces’ framework: the threat of new entrants; the threat of substitutes; the bargaining power of customers; the bargaining power of suppliers; competitive rivalry), or on ‘building a moat’ to counteract competition, and on controlling as much of the process as possible in order to gain from efficiencies. Traditional ‘pipeline’ thinking, say the authors, generally regards external forces as ‘depletive’ (ie extracting value from the company), yet in demand-side economies they can actually be ‘accretive’ (ie adding value). Powerful suppliers and customers can be beneficial rather than threatening, but the trick is in understanding that dynamic in order to shape an ecosystem.</p>
<p class="text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-54" role="doc-pagebreak" title="54"/>This kind of platform thinking is a critical element in empowering organizational agility. If we understand how ecosystems work, how we can capitalize on network effects, and how we might facilitate relationships to create value, we can not only survive but also thrive in the digital age.</p>
<p class="text">And it’s worth noting that is as true of public sector organizations as it is of businesses. When Mike Bracken of the UK Government Digital Service talked about ‘government as platform’ (a phrase originated by Tim O’Reilly some time before<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en31" id="ch02_enx31">31</a></span>) back in 2015, he talked about how siloed approaches to digital transformation create duplication and waste. Instead, the vision he was setting out was about establishing ‘a common core infrastructure of shared digital systems, technology and processes on which it’s easy to build brilliant, user-centric government services’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en32" id="ch02_enx32">32</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The principles that underpin this way of thinking are about frictionless access, efficiency in matching supply with demand, understanding how value flows through a system, and reinforcing feedback loops that enable continuous improvement. And surely they are all things that every organization wants to understand.</p>

<span class="emphasis">ASOS Marketplace</span></h1>
</header>
<p class="text-fo">Digital fashion retailer ASOS launched its Marketplace proposition in 2010 as a platform to support emerging and established boutique fashion businesses. These boutiques are smaller businesses, each selling their own unique styles of clothing, and in many ways are essentially competitive to ASOS. The launch of Marketplace is is perhaps counterintuitive to more traditional thinking, which would be concerned with direct competition and cannibalization of sales. Why would ASOS choose to host potentially competing sellers on its own site?</p>
<p class="text">ASOS Marketplace launched with 20 sellers but since then it has become a leading platform for independent fashion brands and vintage stores with more than 1,000 boutiques from 50 different countries. Marketplace is a destination, giving customers a reason to come back to the retailer’s site again and again (according to analytics business SimilarWeb, Marketplace has 1.8 million visits a month<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en33" id="ch02_enx33">33</a></span>), but it is also a distributed community across social platforms. ASOS takes 20 per cent commission from every sale on the platform. It speaks of a confident brand that is taking a leadership position in its market. But perhaps one of the most valuable yet relatively hidden benefits of the Marketplace platform for ASOS is the learning that it gets from a high volume, broader base of sales. More sales equals more data equals <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-55" role="doc-pagebreak" title="55"/>more learning, and for ASOS this means the ability to identify and respond to changing consumer demand faster, to capitalize on trends in product areas that are at the fringes of its product domain. What might the ASOS Marketplace for your business look like?</p>

<h2 class="head-a" id="ch02_h2_007"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_012">Systems thinking for business</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Since most businesses are operating in increasingly complex adaptive environments it has become more important to develop an appreciation of high-level systems thinking as a way to navigate, solve problems and support change. Emergent strategies are more needed to navigate effectively through complex scenarios and shifting contexts. Businesses increasingly operate as role players within ecosystems that comprise suppliers, partners, customers and other third parties in value-driven networks. And understanding organizational change in terms of systems change (businesses are systems) is progressively more useful. These are all systems related, so the basic principles of systems thinking have never been more relevant.</p>
<p class="text">Australian designer and innovator Leyla Acaroglu has usefully defined six fundamental concepts of systems thinking: interconnectedness; synthesis; emergence; feedback loops; causality and systems mapping.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en34" id="ch02_enx34">34</a></span></p>
<p class="text">One of the core concepts of systems thinking is interconnectedness. Using a definition drawn from systems theory, which was first introduced by biologist L von Bertalanffy in the 1930s, we might first define a system as: ‘a set of related components that work together in a particular environment to perform whatever functions are required to achieve the system’s objective’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en35" id="ch02_enx35">35</a></span></p>
<p class="text">At the most basic level, there are really three main types of system:<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en36" id="ch02_enx36">36</a></span></p>
<ol class="list-number"><li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Social:</span> human-created systems that are created to facilitate and progress human society (including things like education, finance, government and legal systems).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Industrial:</span> any systems to do with products, services, goods and infrastructure that might facilitate and support social systems (examples include transport systems and the parts that comprise them).</p></li>
<li><p class="list-number"><span class="strong">Ecosystems:</span> natural systems that provide the raw materials that support industrial systems, and ultimately sustain life on Earth (examples include the carbon cycle, minerals and fuels – whilst everything in nature is circular, humans have a tendency to make industrial systems linear which, as we’ve discussed, can make them unsustainable).</p></li>
</ol><p class="text-fo"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-56" role="doc-pagebreak" title="56"/>All elements in a system are reliant on something else (and often a complex array of things) for survival. As Leyla Acaroglu puts it:</p>
<blockquote><p class="block-quote">when we say ‘everything is interconnected’ from a systems thinking perspective, we are defining a fundamental principle of life. From this, we can shift the way we see the world, from a linear, structured ‘mechanical worldview’ to a dynamic, chaotic, interconnected array of relationships and feedback loops.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en37" id="ch02_enx37">37</a></span></p>
</blockquote><p class="text-fo">The shift in mindset is therefore from linear to circular, and systems thinking seeks to untangle the relationships between these interconnected things.</p>
<p class="text">If analysis is about breaking complexity down into manageable components and is therefore more reductionist and appropriate for the mechanical, linear view of the world, the goal in systems thinking is synthesis, or how the elements combine to create something new. So this requires an appreciation of not only the individual components, but also the relationships and dynamics between those individual components, and how they combine to create the whole: ‘synthesis is the ability to see interconnectedness’.</p>
<p class="text">Emergence is the result of things interacting and coming together to produce something different. What emerges as a result of the interaction might be completely different from what we set out with or had in mind. As R Buckminster Fuller once said: ‘There is nothing in a caterpillar that tells you it will be a butterfly’.<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en38" id="ch02_enx38">38</a></span></p>
<p class="text">Emergent strategy therefore involves organizations undertaking a series of actions, each perhaps informed by the results of the last action that over time may turn into a consistent pattern of behaviour. In this way it differs from deliberate strategy where a linear set of actions result in something that matches the intended course of action. Deliberate strategy might be akin to rigid, linear business planning that may work well in slow-moving, stable environments but is far less suited to climates that see rapid change and need a more adaptive response. Emergent strategy is that which is constantly evolving, perhaps in diverse ways, in response to changing contexts. Managing it involves not dismissing anything that deviates from the original plan but continually identifying better options and then managing resources flexibly to nourish them.</p>
<p class="text">When elements interact in a system they create constant feedback loops between the components. These feedback loops can either be reinforcing or balancing. A reinforcing feedback loop can happen when elements in a system encourage more of the same thing, which may have a positive impact but which can cause problems if one element continually refines itself to the point where it takes over. An example of this might be how methodologies <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-57" role="doc-pagebreak" title="57"/>can become doctrines in business as they reinforce certain behaviours that can then reduce flexibility and adaptability.</p>
<p class="text">Strategist John Willshire has called this the ‘pattern problem’:<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en39" id="ch02_enx39">39</a></span></p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">An example becomes a lesson.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">A lesson becomes a method.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">A method becomes a practice.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">A practice becomes a doctrine.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">A doctrine becomes death.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">Conversely, balancing feedback loops are self-correcting and produce stability rather than bolstering more of the same (like a predator/prey situation in natural ecosystems). But dramatic changes in the ecosystem can turn balancing feedback loops into reinforcing ones.</p>
<p class="text">In a dynamic constantly evolving system, understanding feedback loops and causality, or how elements influence each other, becomes important.</p>
<p class="text">It’s useful to map systems, particularly when we’re looking to change them. When we map systems, we need to take account of not only the component elements, but also the connections, relationships and feedback loops between them. We can then develop insights around interventions or strategies that can shape the system in the most effective way. Simple approaches to systems mapping include:</p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">actor or stakeholder maps: these show individuals and/or organizations that are important players in the system and how they are related and connected;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">mind maps: these can be used to show influences, changes or trends in the external environment that might influence the issue;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">issue maps: these can be used to set out a given set of issues (social, political, economic) around an entity or problem;</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">causal-loop diagrams: these are designed to show the feedback loops (both positive and negative) between players that might impact behaviour or outcomes.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">There are various methodologies for mapping systems including cluster maps, where the problem, question or topic goes in the centre, and all the related elements of the system are mapped around that with the connections between them drawn on. Or we might use interconnected circles to investigate the relationships inherent in a system, where the elements of that system <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-58" role="doc-pagebreak" title="58"/>are placed around a large circle and the relationships between them connected up. Or we might map out the feedback loops involved in a system as a way to consider how it works.</p>
<p class="text">The point is that every organization is a system, and more than ever in the digital world every company sits within a system and a network of connections. Mapping that system and the relationships within it is a good starting point for informing our understanding of where we are now, and how we might change it. In business, modern value generation is less about rigid, linear processes and more about networked relationships. If businesses increasingly operate as part of more complex ecosystems, we need to be able to map the component parts, to appreciate the relationship, feedback loops and causality between them, and how we can establish and orchestrate successful networks that work for everyone involved.</p>
<h2 class="head-a" id="ch02_h2_008"><a href="03_toc01.xhtml#fm_toc_013">Genuine (and pretend) customer-centricity</a></h2>
<p class="text-fo">Enough has been written about customer-centric approaches for there to be a high level of understanding about exactly what they mean. Enough businesses have put the phrase in their mission statements and strategy documents for there to be little doubt of its importance. And yet so many customer experiences remain poor; so many customer journeys are broken; so many customers are left frustrated and annoyed rather than surprised and delighted.</p>
<p class="text">Some of this may well be a result of the fact that, in spite of the promise of new technology and the fact that many smart technologies have been around for a relatively long time, we still find it so hard to reimagine experiences, simplify complexity, and empathize well. We’re often stuck in looking at the new through the lens of the old and not rethinking from the ground up. This is the ‘mid-stage’ of digital that Tom Goodwin, author of <span class="emphasis">Digi</span><span class="emphasis">tal Darwinism: Survival of the fittest in the age of business d</span><span class="emphasis">isruption</span>, describes: ‘We’re in a hybrid period between two ages. We live in an analogue world augmented by the new possibilities of digital, but not rethought or rebuilt for this era.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en40" id="ch02_enx40">40</a></span></p>
<p class="text">The intentions of many executives are often good, but the real challenge with being genuinely customer-centric is that businesses have ingrained habits to do things for business-centric reasons. They create experiences that make sense for an organization’s operating procedures, or structures, or efficiency requirements, but which make no sense for the customer. When it actually comes down to it, most leaders in businesses are actually incentivized and rewarded for doing things that are business-centric, not customer-centric. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-59" role="doc-pagebreak" title="59"/>We undervalue qualities such as empathy or skills like good design because there is no immediate payback. The more senior you get in a company the further away you tend to get from real customers, so it becomes harder to understand real needs, real problems, and connect execution with the reality of experience.</p>
<p class="text">The only way around this is to completely orient your business towards the customer. To not let a few teams or departments be the only ones that get in front of real customers. To embed customer needs in organizational mission, strategy, priorities, tactics and execution and measures. It has to be inherent to the working methodologies. And it has to be part of the very culture of the organization.</p>

<p class="text-fo">Amazon’s ‘working backwards’ approach is widely used in the business as a way to pitch new propositions and provide a north star for customer-centric product development and continuous iteration of customer value. Working backwards from the customer is the opposite of the more traditional approach of starting with an idea for a new product or service and then trying to find customers who actually want it.</p>
<p class="text">When pitching a new idea, for example, a product manager begins by writing an internal press release targeting the new/updated product’s customers and announcing the finished product. Time is spent finessing this press release as it contains key information about the customer’s problem, why or how the current solutions are failing, and why and how the new proposition is going to address this. This provides not only a guiding vision for what the proposition is that can be used at all stages of development, but also acts as a gut-check for whether or not the product or service is exciting enough to actually build. If it’s not exciting enough, the product manager needs to iterate or abandon the release. This prevents unnecessary spend as iterating on the release is a lot more cost effective than iterating on the product itself. An example outline for the press release is:<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en41" id="ch02_enx41">41</a></span></p>
<ul class="list-bullet"><li><p class="list-bullet">Heading – Name the product in a way the reader and target customers will understand.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Subheading – In one sentence below the heading, describe who is the market for the product and what benefit end-users get.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Summary – An important paragraph to summarize the product and the benefit. This needs to assume that the customer/reader will not read anything else to make sure it captures exactly what the product is.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page-60" role="doc-pagebreak" title="60"/>Problem – Answering the question of what problem the product is solving.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Solution – Exactly how the product is solving the problem better and more elegantly.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Quote from you – An imaginary quote from a company spokesperson about why the product is exciting.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">How to get started – How can you make it easy to get started?</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Customer quote – A quote from a hypothetical customer describing the experience and the benefit that he or she gets.</p></li>
<li><p class="list-bullet">Closing and call to action – Pointers for more information, where the reader should go next, and wrap up.</p></li>
</ul><p class="text-fo">It’s worth keeping the press release short and simple, perhaps a maximum of two pages, with no wording that doesn’t add to the quality of the description, no jargon, and a good flow to the narrative. If there is a need for more information, that can be included in an accompanying FAQ as a way of ensuring that the press release stays focused on the customer benefit. As Ian McAllister, Director at Airbnb and ex-Amazon staffer notes about working backwards, once the project moves into development the release can act like a guiding light for the team to ensure that they are building what was in the release and no more: ‘This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn’t provide real customer benefit.’<span class="sup"><a href="#ch02_en42" id="ch02_enx42">42</a></span></p>
